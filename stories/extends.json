    "content": "\"You don't have to be French to enjoy a decent red wine,\" Charles Jousselin de Gruse used to tell his foreign guests whenever he entertained them in Paris. \"But you do have to be French to recognize one,\" he would add with a laugh.\n\nAfter a lifetime in the French diplomatic corps, the Count de Gruse lived with his wife in an elegant townhouse on Quai Voltaire. He was a likeable man, cultivated of course, with a well-deserved reputation as a generous host and an amusing raconteur.\n\nThis evening's guests were all European and all equally convinced that immigration was at the root of Europe's problems. Charles de Gruse said nothing. He had always concealed his contempt for such ideas. And, in any case, he had never much cared for these particular guests.\n\nThe first of the red Bordeaux was being served with the veal, and one of the guests turned to de Gruse.\n\n\"Come on, Charles, it's simple arithmetic. Nothing to do with race or colour. You must've had bags of experience of this sort of thing. What d'you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, General. Bags!\"\n\nWithout another word, de Gruse picked up his glass and introduced his bulbous, winey nose. After a moment he looked up with watery eyes.\n\n\"A truly full-bodied Bordeaux,\" he said warmly, \"a wine among wines.\"\n\nThe four guests held their glasses to the light and studied their blood-red contents. They all agreed that it was the best wine they had ever tasted.\n\nOne by one the little white lights along the Seine were coming on, and from the first-floor windows you could see the brightly lit bateaux-mouches passing through the arches of the Pont du Carrousel. The party moved on to a dish of game served with a more vigorous claret.\n\n\"Can you imagine,\" asked de Gruse, as the claret was poured, \"that there are people who actually serve wines they know nothing about?\"\n\n\"Really?\" said one of the guests, a German politician.\n\n\"Personally, before I uncork a bottle I like to know what's in it.\"\n\n\"But how? How can anyone be sure?\"\n\n\"I like to hunt around the vineyards. Take this place I used to visit in Bordeaux. I got to know the winegrower there personally. That's the way to know what you're drinking.\"\n\n\"A matter of pedigree, Charles,\" said the other politician.\n\n\"This fellow,\" continued de Gruse as though the Dutchman had not spoken, \"always gave you the story behind his wines. One of them was the most extraordinary story I ever heard. We were tasting, in his winery, and we came to a cask that made him frown. He asked if I agreed with him that red Bordeaux was the best wine in the world. Of course, I agreed. Then he made the strangest statement.\n\n\"'The wine in this cask,' he said, and there were tears in his eyes, 'is the best vintage in the world. But it started its life far from the country where it was grown.'\"\n\nDe Gruse paused to check that his guests were being served.\n\n\"Well?\" said the Dutchman.\n\nDe Gruse and his wife exchanged glances.\n\n\"Do tell them, mon chéri,\" she said.\n\nDe Gruse leaned forwards, took another sip of wine, and dabbed his lips with the corner of his napkin. This is the story he told them.\n\nAt the age of twenty-one, Pierre - that was the name he gave the winegrower - had been sent by his father to spend some time with his uncle in Madagascar. Within two weeks he had fallen for a local girl called Faniry, or \"Desire\" in Malagasy. You could not blame him. At seventeen she was ravishing. In the Malagasy sunlight her skin was golden. Her black, waist-length hair, which hung straight beside her cheeks, framed large, fathomless eyes. It was a genuine coup de foudre, for both of them. Within five months they were married. Faniry had no family, but Pierre's parents came out from France for the wedding, even though they did not strictly approve of it, and for three years the young couple lived very happily on the island of Madagascar. Then, one day, a telegram came from France. Pierre's parents and his only brother had been killed in a car crash. Pierre took the next flight home to attend the funeral and manage the vineyard left by his father.\n\nFaniry followed two weeks later. Pierre was grief-stricken, but with Faniry he settled down to running the vineyard. His family, and the lazy, idyllic days under a tropical sun, were gone forever. But he was very happily married, and he was very well-off. Perhaps, he reasoned, life in Bordeaux would not be so bad.\n\nBut he was wrong. It soon became obvious that Faniry was jealous. In Madagascar she had no match. In France she was jealous of everyone. Of the maids. Of the secretary. Even of the peasant girls who picked the grapes and giggled at her funny accent. She convinced herself that Pierre made love to each of them in turn.\n\nShe started with insinuations, simple, artless ones that Pierre hardly even recognized. Then she tried blunt accusation in the privacy of their bedroom. When he denied that, she resorted to violent, humiliating denouncements in the kitchens, the winery, the plantations. The angel that Pierre had married in Madagascar had become a termagant, blinded by jealousy. Nothing he did or said could help. Often, she would refuse to speak for a week or more, and when at last she spoke it would only be to scream yet more abuse or swear again her intention to leave him. By the third vine-harvest it was obvious to everyone that they loathed each other.\n\nOne Friday evening, Pierre was down in the winery, working on a new electric winepress. He was alone. The grape-pickers had left. Suddenly the door opened and Faniry entered, excessively made up. She walked straight up to Pierre, flung her arms around his neck, and pressed herself against him. Even above the fumes from the pressed grapes he could smell that she had been drinking.\n\n\"Darling,\" she sighed, \"what shall we do?\"\n\nHe badly wanted her, but all the past insults and humiliating scenes welled up inside him. He pushed her away.\n\n\"But, darling, I'm going to have a baby.\"\n\n\"Don't be absurd. Go to bed! You're drunk. And take that paint off. It makes you look like a tart.\"\n\nFaniry's face blackened, and she threw herself at him with new accusations. He had never cared for her. He cared only about sex. He was obsessed with it. And with white women. But the women in France, the white women, they were the tarts, and he was welcome to them. She snatched a knife from the wall and lunged at him with it. She was in tears, but it took all his strength to keep the knife from his throat. Eventually he pushed her off, and she stumbled towards the winepress. Pierre stood, breathing heavily, as the screw of the press caught at her hair and dragged her in. She screamed, struggling to free herself. The screw bit slowly into her shoulder and she screamed again. Then she fainted, though whether from the pain or the fumes he was not sure. He looked away until a sickening sound told him it was over. Then he raised his arm and switched the current off.\n\nThe guests shuddered visibly and de Gruse paused in his story.\n\n\"Well, I won't go into the details at table,\" he said. \"Pierre fed the rest of the body into the press and tidied up. Then he went up to the house, had a bath, ate a meal, and went to bed. The next day, he told everyone Faniry had finally left him and gone back to Madagascar. No-one was surprised.\"\n\nHe paused again. His guests sat motionless, their eyes turned towards him.\n\n\"Of course,\" he continued, \"Sixty-five was a bad year for red Bordeaux. Except for Pierre's. That was the extraordinary thing. It won award after award, and nobody could understand why.\"\n\nThe general's wife cleared her throat.\n\n\"But, surely,\" she said, \"you didn't taste it?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't taste it, though Pierre did assure me his wife had lent the wine an incomparable aroma.\"\n\n\"And you didn't, er, buy any?\" asked the general.\n\n\"How could I refuse? It isn't every day that one finds such a pedigree.\"\n\nThere was a long silence. The Dutchman shifted awkwardly in his seat, his glass poised midway between the table and his open lips. The other guests looked around uneasily at each other. They did not understand.\n\n\"But look here, Gruse,\" said the general at last, \"you don't mean to tell me we're drinking this damned woman now, d'you?\"\n\nDe Gruse gazed impassively at the Englishman.\n\n\"Heaven forbid, General,\" he said slowly. \"Everyone knows that the best vintage should always come first.\"",

    "content": "David and Emma looked at each other across the table. The young couple were happy: the food was delicious, the light from the candles was soft and the music was perfect. \n\nDavid looked at Emma's beautiful smile. All the pain of his last break-up disappeared. All his doubts and fears about love had gone. His hand reached out and touched hers. \n\n'I want to ask you something.' David searched her eyes. Could she guess what was coming? \n\nHer smile made him feel brave. She held his hand. 'Don't worry. Whatever it is, I'll probably say yes!' \n\nHe felt so excited. He was about to ask the most important question of his life.\n\nFrom the corner of the restaurant, a strange man watched them. He sat very still at his table. He held a menu but he wasn't reading it. Instead, his cold eyes looked only at the young couple. \n\nBack at their table, David suddenly felt nervous. \n\n'Excuse me,' he said to Emma. He pushed his chair back and went to the toilet. As he looked in the mirror, he told himself: 'Come on, David, come on! You can do this, mate! She's crazy about you!'\n\nFeeling ready, he went out of the bathroom. He almost walked into the extremely tall man who was waiting by the door. The man's eyes were a cold, bright blue. His face was pale with a sharp, pointed nose and thin, pale lips. \n\n'Oh, sorry!' said David. \n\n'Which one?' the man hissed. He spoke with a strong and strange accent. David had never heard that accent before.\n\nFor a moment, David was confused. Then he realised what the other man meant.\n\n'Oh … this one!' said David, helpfully. 'This is the men's toilet!'\n\nDavid went back into the restaurant. He reached for the ring in a box in his pocket. It was time to ask her! \n\n...\n\nThe taxi ride home was wonderful. The happy couple discussed their future life together. They shared their sweet feelings about each other. \n\n'The night I asked you to marry me!' said David. \n\n'The night I said yes!' replied Emma. \n\n'Just think, our whole lives together!' \n\n'Sharing, caring, …' he began.\n\n'... loving, giving!' Emma finished his sentence.\n\nThey smiled at each other in loving excitement. \n\n'You are so wonderful!' said David.\n\n'And you're absolutely beautiful!' said Emma. 'I've never met anyone so lovely and kind! I'm so happy I could sing!' \n\nThey entered their block of flats, holding hands. A tall man watched them from the shadows. \n\n'Which one?' he asked himself.\n\nHe watched the building. He was waiting for a light to come on to show him which flat was theirs. One minute passed … two … there it was! The light went on in a third-floor window. He saw Emma for a moment as she closed the curtains. \n\nHow many times had he stood on a corner like this? How many victims had he watched? Many corners! Many victims! His pale lips formed a thin smile. He moved out of the shadows to the door and pressed the buttons for every flat. The vampire was always pleased when people lived in flats. Sooner or later someone always let you in. Silly humans! They thought you were someone's pizza delivery. It was a kind of invitation, and that was all he needed to enter a home. \n\nHe climbed the stairs to the third floor and walked down the hall. He didn't make a sound. He could hear the young couple laughing and talking. He put his ear against the door. He could hear what they were saying and he was happy. Young love made the sweetest blood. It was so full of life and energy.\n\n'I feel as if I'm in a film,' she was saying.  \n\n'More like a dream,' he replied.\n\n'Yes, a dream. How lucky we are!' \n\nGuess who I'll be dreaming about tonight?' he said.\n\n'Who? Who?' \n\n'Her hair smells of roses! She's like an angel!'\n\nTheir dream was about to become a nightmare, the listening vampire thought. Suddenly, he opened the door and stood there, showing his sharp teeth. The couple screamed and then held each other in terrified silence. The vampire could smell and taste their fear. This was how he liked it. Fear also made the blood sweeter.\n\n'There's my wallet! On the table, there! Take it!' said David. 'Take anything you want!'\n\n'I will take anything I want!' the vampire replied. \n\n'Fine! Fine! We won't stop you, I promise!' David cried.\n\n'You won't stop me. I promise!' replied the vampire.\n\nThe light shone on the sharp teeth. A terrible thought came to David and Emma at the same time. \n\n'Look at his teeth! Is he ... ?'\n\n'A vampire!!'\n\n'Which one?' the vampire hissed. 'It can be … only one!'\n\nThe couple's eyes were big and afraid. Their mouths open in horror. They held each other's hands and their stomachs filled with fear. \n\n'Already tonight,' continued the vampire, 'I have drunk from three. One more ... then … I can … sleep … and feel young again.'\n\nThe vampire moved towards them. Instinct made David step in front of Emma to protect her. Emma gratefully held onto his back. \n\nThe vampire wasn't in a hurry. He had plenty of time. Who should he attack? he asked himself. Which one? \n\n'Thank you,' Emma said quietly in David's ear, 'for what you're doing for me.'\n\n'Of course, my love. I'm here to protect you.' He felt proud as he said the words. He could fight this vampire. All he needed was a piece of wood or something to push through the heart. He looked around for something ...\n\n'You're so brave to offer yourself,' continued Emma. \n\n'Sorry?' asked David. 'What are you talking about?'\n\n'Oh!' said Emma. 'I just thought that with your love for me and everything …'\n\nDavid and the vampire looked at each other.\n\n'Now, listen, Emma. There is no doubt about my love for you!'\n\n'Really?' she replied. She didn't believe him. \n\n'But you can't expect me to just give him my life!'\n\n'I wasn't saying you should!' she said. 'It's just one of our options, that's all!'\n\n'Well, think of another one!' he shouted. 'Why don't you offer yourself to him to save me!'\n\nThe atmosphere in the room had certainly turned ugly. The vampire was not pleased that the fear and love were now silly, selfish arguments.\n\nEmma was very angry. 'I hope you're joking!'\n\n'Let's see how strong your love is!' \n\n'What a horrible man!' \n\n'What about the woman I was planning to marry?! Offering me to a vampire like a bone to a dog!'\n\n'You said my hair smells of roses!' she cried. \n\n'All right, all right! Relax!' David was a little embarrassed to be having this argument in front of a stranger. \n\n'I'm an angel, you said!' she carried on shouting.\n\n'MUST … DRINK!' shouted the vampire angrily as he came even closer. He wanted to make a quick kill. Then he could get away from these terrible people as soon as possible. \n\nHis eyes opened wider and his teeth were bared. 'WHICH ... ONE?' \n\n'HER!' David pointed at his future wife. \n\n'HIM! HIM!' screamed Emma in anger. 'Please, HIM!' \n\nThe vampire approached David. \n\n'She's younger! Sweeter!' said David. \n\nThe vampire turned to Emma. \n\n'He's bigger! There's more of him!' She pointed at David. \n\nSuddenly the vampire felt tired. He had been killing for many centuries. Listening to them was depressing. How could he feel good by drinking the blood of either of these disgusting creatures? \n\nHe looked down at their terrified faces and shouted, 'BAD BLOOD!' \n\nAnd with that, he disappeared into the night air and left Emma and David alone together. Together, as they had promised, for the rest of their lives.",

    "content": "Dr Tomas Streyer looked around the control room at his team of scientists and engineers. He was excited and frightened but he tried to seem calm. In a few minutes, they might start to discover something amazing: how the universe began.\n\nHe looked out of the window at the beautiful blue summer sky and tried to breathe slowly.\n\n'Ready,' he said. He pressed the first button and the complicated computers and machines came to life.\n\n'Set,' he said. He pressed the second button and switched on the large particle accelerator that lay under the towns and fields of Switzerland. \n\n'Go,' he said. And, at exactly twelve o'clock, he pressed the final button.\n\nFor a second, he felt as if he was blind, because everything went completely black. Tomas shouted in shock, but the lights were already on again. That was not part of his plan. He had no idea what had just happened.\n\n'Everybody, check the systems!' he ordered. But nothing seemed to be wrong with them. The particle accelerator was working perfectly.  \n\n'Tomas,' said his assistant. 'Look outside.' She sounded afraid.\n\nThe perfect summer's day of five minutes ago had gone. Instead, the sky was darker than the blackest night. But that wasn't the worst thing. The sun wasn't there, and the moon and stars were also gone.\n\nPeople were shouting and screaming. They started calling their families on the telephone because they were afraid they had all gone too. Tomas felt as if it was hard to breathe, but he counted to ten and tried to breathe slowly. He sat at the main computer and started reading the information and numbers from his experiment. But he couldn’t find anything to explain what was happening. He ran out of the exit with the rest of his team until they were all outside the building. \n\nEveryone else in the building was outside, frightened and confused. They were using the screens and lights on their mobile phones to see better. Several people got in their cars and turned on the lights. They drove to the entrance to make a small area of light for everybody to stand together. The street lights turned on, but most people were still afraid. \n\nThen, almost twenty minutes after Tomas had started the particle accelerator, the sun was in the sky again. It was warm and yellow, and the black sky turned blue again. Everyone started laughing and dancing around, and Tomas felt as if he could breathe normally again. \n\nBut later, hours later, when the real night began, no one was happy. Because, although the moon rose again, there were no stars in the sky at all.\n\n…\n\nNo one wanted to know what Tomas' work was actually about. They didn't care what the particle accelerator was for. What did that matter? All they cared about was what had happened after he turned the machine on. He had stolen all the stars – or that's what the newspapers said. And when they made him go to the International Criminal Court, they charged him with stealing the stars. \n\nTomas said, 'I'm not guilty.'\n\n'Well, if you didn’t steal the stars, Dr Streyer,' said the lawyer for the prosecution, 'what did you do?'\n\n'If you're asking about my work,' said Tomas, 'we didn't do anything. We showed that the machine was working, that's all.'\n\n'Taking the stars from the sky seems like nothing to you?' The lawyer looked around at the people in the court. 'No one here would think it's nothing. No one in the world would think it's nothing.'\n\n'That's not what I meant,' said Tomas. 'But I can tell you this: when the machine started, there were suddenly no photons in the test room.'\n\n'What? Photons? We aren't all scientists here! Speak simple English, Dr Streyer!'\n\n'Light,' said Tomas. 'For just a moment it was as if there was no light in our laboratory. Then we saw it was also dark outside … until the light became normal again.'\n\n'Normal, Dr Streyer? It wasn't normal when …' – the lawyer checked his notes – '… the sun went out for exactly sixteen minutes and forty seconds. Perhaps we can say the rest of the day was normal. But the night hasn't been normal ever since, has it?'\n\nTomas looked sad. 'I know. But you must believe me. I didn't do anything that could have taken the stars from the sky!'\n\n'So are you saying you didn't steal the stars from us?' said the lawyer.\n\n'No, I didn't steal them,' Tomas said.\n\n'You just made it so that we can't see them any more.'\n\nAfter a long pause, Tomas spoke. 'Yes,' he said.\n\n'How is that any different?' the lawyer asked.\n\nTomas didn't have an answer, not one anyone would understand anyway. And if they understood it, they wouldn't believe him. He had an idea, but it would take years to prove it.\n\nInstead, he changed his mind and said, 'I'm guilty.'\n\n…\n\nNow the world could blame someone for what it had lost. But there was no point sending Tomas to prison for years. It wouldn't change anything. Instead, they designed a punishment especially for him. \n\nThey sent Tomas to work at the Extremely Large Telescope in Paranal in Chile. Nobody used the telescope now. No tourists came to these high mountains to see the edges of our galaxy. No scientists asked for money to study the empty sky. All that passed through the night sky was the lonely moon and a few planets. Looking up made people feel bad.\n\nTomas thought it was fair that they punished him. And the job was almost the same as prison because he was completely alone. After a few years, the world forgot about him. Or, at least, everyone decided to leave him alone. Every evening he watched the sun go down. The red ball was gone exactly eight minutes and twenty seconds after it actually went behind the Earth. Tomas was almost happy to know that the laws of physics remained the same. Light still travelled at the same speed as it had always travelled. He hoped it meant he hadn't changed the universe that much. We know there is a speed light travels at, he thought, so perhaps the dark travels at the same speed. \n\nOf course, there was no way to prove his idea. Not yet. And, alone in the mountains, Tomas had nobody to share his idea with anyway.\n\n…\n\nHigh in the mountains of Chile, Tomas continued to watch the night sky. With the enormous telescope, he looked at the same place in the empty sky every night, even though there was nothing to see. And each day as the sun went down, he thought of the song his parents sang to him as a child:\n\n \n\nStar light, star bright,\nFirst star I see tonight,\nI wish I may, I wish I might,\nHave the wish I wish tonight.\n\n \n\nFor 1,596 black nights – nearly four and a half years – there was no change to the night sky. But that was OK. It didn't mean his idea was wrong. Tomas thought about the darkness he had created. He imagined it like a wave that had passed the sun. Now, maybe, it was continuing out towards the edge of our galaxy and further, to the stars. It would take 1,596 nights to pass the nearest star. It would take 1,596 more nights for that star's light to come back to Earth ... If the wave was real, of course. If his ideas were correct. If he was wrong, the stars were really gone forever. \n\n…\n\nAnd then one night 1,596 nights later, almost nine years after that terrible day, Tomas looked up from his telescope. There was Alpha Centauri twinkling back at him from the night sky.\n\nThe first star.\n\nHe felt tears in his eyes and he made a wish. And he imagined millions of other people were making their wishes too.",

    "content": "Sergeant Frank Spike sat behind his desk and looked out of the window. Outside, cars moved slowly in the cold, grey rain. He looked down at the grey hairs on his arms. His round stomach pushed against the desk. This was his final month before he retired from the police. For Frank, his last day couldn't come too soon. \n\nFrank felt angry as he thought about the money he would get when he retired. It wasn't enough money to pay for a short holiday on the cold and rainy east coast of England where he lived. It certainly wouldn't pay for his dream holiday – a luxury, round-the-world cruise.\n\nJust then, Inspector Spencer came to Frank's desk. Spencer had perfect white teeth and he was always smiling. Three years earlier, Spencer had been promoted. Now he was an inspector at the young age of forty. Frank wasn't so lucky. He had worked for the police for forty years and he was still a sergeant. Frank knew he wasn't as handsome or as friendly as Spencer, sorry, Inspector Spencer. But Frank was a better policeman. Frank had 'a nose for crime' and Spencer didn't. That 'nose' meant Frank could think like a criminal and solve the most difficult crimes. As a result, the younger man often asked for Frank's help. In fact, it was the only time Spencer spoke to him.\n\n'Hey, Frank, can I ask you something?' asked Spencer.\n\nFrank wasn't surprised. \n\n'Do you know who the Babbingtons are?' Spencer continued.\n\nEveryone knew who the Babbingtons were. Ronald Babbington was the super-rich owner of Babbington Oil, and his wife Tabitha was a model. Together they loved showing how rich they were. They often appeared in magazines like Hello!, with their beautiful house and their collection of cars. Last month, Ronald had bought an enormous diamond for Tabitha. The diamond sat in a large gold and glass case at the end of a long, red carpet. There was an alarm system to keep it safe.\n\nSpencer continued to explain. \n\n'Someone told us about a plan to steal the Babbington diamond!'\n\nFrank tried to look as though he was surprised.\n\n'Peggy, the owner of the Dog and Duck pub, heard two local criminals making the plan,' Spencer said. 'She asked us to keep her name secret, of course.'\n\n'OK,' Frank said. He waited for the question he knew would come.\n\n'So?' Spencer asked. 'What should we do? They haven't committed a crime yet.' \n\nFrank looked out of the window. He remembered his retirement money. He didn't want to be alone in his retirement, but the money wouldn't even be enough to buy a cat.\n\nThe sound of a car outside brought him back to the conversation with Spencer. He put his fingers together under his chin to look as if he was thinking. In fact, he was, but not in the way Inspector Spencer expected.\n\n'Listen, do this the clever way,' said Frank. 'Let them steal the diamond. If you catch them with the diamond, you can arrest them, no problem.'\n\n'But, Frank,' said Spencer, 'we would need the Babbingtons to agree. And there are laws against trying to trick criminals like that, you know!' \n\n'That's why you let them steal the diamond. Then, as if by chance, you stop them for driving too fast as they escape. Search the car and find the diamond. You don't need to tell anyone that we knew about their plan. And they'll go to prison.' \n\n'Hmmmm. OK.' Spencer was uncomfortable with the idea Frank was suggesting. But he knew it would work. \n\nFrank continued, 'Of course, the officer who arrests them needs to be reliable.'\n\nSpencer understood immediately. \n\n'Are you sure you want to do it, Frank? It could be dangerous.'\n\n'I'll take two young officers with me. But, yes, of course I want to do it.'\n\n'Why?' asked Spencer. 'You're going to retire soon! Don't you want to take it easy?'\n\n'That's exactly why I want to do it,' Frank replied. 'My last case will be my best!'\n\n*****\n\nA few days later, Frank visited the Dog and Duck pub after work. \n\n'Did you get it?' he asked Peggy as she gave him his drink. \n\n'Yes. I have now got a perfect copy of the Babbington diamond,' she said. 'I told the glassmaker I was a big fan of the Babbingtons. And I said that my boyfriend wouldn't buy me a diamond of my own.' \n\n'You need a new boyfriend,' said Frank. 'If I were your boyfriend, I'd buy you a diamond ring and take you on a long luxury cruise.'\n\n'Oh, really?' she said and smiled.\n\n*****\n\nFrank was sitting in the back seat of the police car. The car was hidden in a small road next to the Babbington house. In the front seats were two strong, young police officers. \n\nAt 23.30, a message came in on the police radio. The thieves, a man and a tall woman, had met outside the Dog and Duck pub. At 23.37, they got into a car. The man started the car and drove away from the pub. \n\nAt midnight, the thieves passed the hidden police car on the way to the Babbingtons' house. At 00.13, the woman climbed over one of the garden walls. A second hidden police team watched her climb over, while the man waited in the car.  \n\nAt 00.20, the woman climbed back over the wall. She had an excited smile on her face. She ran back to the car. Smiling, the man waited for her to jump in and then they drove away. \n\n*****\n\nAlmost immediately, the thieves passed Frank's car. The young police officer in the driver's seat switched on the blue lights and followed them. \n\nInside the car, the thieves were afraid.\n\n'What are they doing here?' the man shouted. 'You said you turned off the alarms!'\n\n'Relax, I did,' she replied. 'Remember, the police don't know what we've done. Just be normal! We can walk away from this with the diamond.'\n\nThe man stopped the car and opened his window. \n\n'Is there a problem, officer?' he asked. His face was red and shiny because he was so nervous. \n\n'You were speeding. We'll need to give you a ticket. Can you both get out of the car, please?' \n\nThe man still looked nervous. One officer wrote the speeding ticket and the other stood close in case they ran away. Frank began to search the car.\n\n'Hey! What's he doing?' the woman said. But she knew the game was over. \n\nFrank breathed heavily as he started looking under the seats. His hand felt something smooth, hard and cold under the front passenger seat. The Babbington diamond! He took the diamond and put it in his jacket pocket. At the same time, with his other hand, he took something very similar out of his trouser pocket. He held it up. \n\n'OK, you two!' he said. 'You are under arrest for stealing this diamond!' \n\n****\n\nWhile the young police officers arrested the criminals, Frank held the evidence up for everyone to see. In the light from the moon, it shone every colour.  \n\n'Wow!' said one of the young police officers. 'I've never seen a real diamond up close.' \n\n'Imagine if someone gave you that as a present!' said the other. \n\n'Just imagine,' Frank agreed. He carefully put it into an evidence bag. Half an hour later, back at the station, he gave it to Spencer. Spencer took it from him carefully, as if it was a new baby. \n\n*****\n\nFive weeks later, Frank was sitting in his new armchair and drinking a glass of the best champagne. His expensive new cat sat at his feet. \n\nHe picked up the local newspaper. The two thieves had got six years in prison. The photo in the newspaper was of the Babbingtons. They were standing next to the diamond inside its new, extra-strong glass case. Frank looked closer at the photo of the diamond. \n\nOnly an expert would notice anything strange about the Babbington diamond. And only if they saw the diamond up close. \n\nFrank put the newspaper down and picked up one of the travel magazines on his beautiful new coffee table. \n\n'Peggy?' he said. 'Would you like to go to the Bahamas or the Maldives?'\n\nPeggy put down her own champagne glass. A small diamond ring on her finger shone in the light. 'Why not both?' she smiled. \n\n'I did promise you a long cruise,' he said. \n\n'You did!' she replied. 'I'm so glad I called you first when I heard them planning to steal the diamond.'\n\n'Me too, Peggy,' he said. 'Me too.'\n\nLife now he had retired was a wonderful thing after all. ",

    "content": "Kate looked around the room at the other people: ten men and ten women all around the same age. \n\n'Thank you for coming today and offering your time to help with our research! Limeren, the medicine we're testing, is in the final stage of testing. Previous human trials have shown us that Limeren is completely safe ...'\n\nKate stopped paying attention. She'd read the information the medical research company had sent her, so she knew that Limeren had already been approved for sale and that they were not testing to see if there were side effects. She didn't know any of the other people in the group. She guessed that none of them had jobs either or they wouldn't be earning money by testing medicine. But otherwise it was impossible to know if she had anything in common with any of them. She hoped so, or four days in the research centre would feel like a very long time.\n\n'... as side effects, we know that some people experience stronger emotions and a feeling of general happiness,' the head researcher said. 'We'll be interviewing each of you and doing tests during the day and night. So if you can all sign the forms, we can start.'\n\nKate signed her form without reading the information. Hopefully, this was going to be a very easy way to make money. \n\n'I hope the food's better than last time,' said the guy sitting next to her as he gave in his form. \n\nKate smiled. \n\n'I'm Michael.' \n\n'Kate,' she said. 'Have you been here before?'\n\n'I do these trials as often as they'll let me!' He laughed. 'It's such an easy way to make money!' \n\nShe smiled back. Here was someone she had something in common with.\n\n...\n\nA few hours later, Kate was eating dinner. She had taken her second Limeren tablet before dinner. She was feeling really relaxed. Maybe it was the vitamins, or maybe it was just because she had so much free time and there was nothing she needed to do. There were books to read, films to watch and even board games and puzzles. At home, she had to send out job applications. Or she had to go to stressful job interviews. After more than twenty applications she still didn't have a job. \n\nShe looked up and saw Michael smiling at her. 'Do you want to play a board game?' he asked. His eyes were really dark brown, Kate thought. She hadn't noticed that earlier. She felt her cheeks go red. 'Sure,' she replied. 'But I like to win,' she warned. \n\n'Perfect,' he said. 'Me too!' \n\nWas it her imagination or did his cheeks look a bit pink too? \n\n...\n\nFor the next two days, Kate and Michael spent hours and hours playing games, chatting and watching films. \n\n'I feel as if I've known you for months, not days,' she said. She already knew he lived nearby, that he was a student studying for his PhD and that he had dimples in his cheeks when he smiled and a cute way of putting a pen behind his ear when he was reading. She wasn't sure, but she thought he was trying to sit next to her for meals and spend time with her whenever he could. Or maybe she was the one who was always looking for him.\n\n'So, do you think you're feeling any side effects?' he asked her one evening. They were sitting on the sofa, watching a film. Michael's knee was almost touching her leg, and if his hand moved just a little, it would be touching hers. Her heart beat faster and all she could think about was being near enough for his skin to touch hers. Her face was red again, she knew it.\n\n'Any what?' she asked, trying to concentrate on their conversation instead. \n\n'The side effects of Limeren that they told us about at the presentation,' he said, moving his hand away. Her skin immediately felt cold, as if his hand had been making the air between them warm. \n\n'Oh, I wasn't really listening,' she said. 'We still get paid anyway, don't we?'\n\nAnd then he did it. He moved his hand so that it covered hers. A nice feeling travelled all the way through her fingers and across her skin. She turned her hand over and held his hand. He smiled and moved his face towards hers.\n\n'Can everyone come and get their next Limeren, please?' called a nurse. Michael dropped her hand and followed the rest of the group to the nurse's room. Kate couldn't remember ever feeling so happy.\n\n...\n\n'Thank you everyone for taking part. You're now free to go,' the head researcher said the next morning as the trial ended. 'Any side effects will disappear over the next few days. If you have felt any strong feelings, and happiness, those feelings will decrease. Fortunately, we don't expect anyone to become depressed. However, we will keep in touch with all of you in the next few days to make sure everything is fine.'\n\n'We can have our first date now,' Michael said to Kate. 'Breakfast?'\n\nOver breakfast, they talked and talked. Kate knew she was in love. It was stupid, but it was true. Michael said it first. \n\n'I can't believe I met you. I've never felt like this about anyone before.'\n\n'This does feel amazing,' Kate said. But she had been worried about something since the beginning of the trial. She hadn't wanted to think about it but now she had to ask him a serious question.\n\n'You don't think …?'\n\n'What?'\n\n'What if it's the Limeren making us feel like this? What was it he said about strong feelings?' \n\n'There's only one way to find out!' he said. 'If you don't want to be my girlfriend any more after a few days, we'll know it was just the Limeren.'\n\nShe smiled at the word 'girlfriend.' 'Maybe your side effects will go away first!' \n\n'Maybe!' He laughed. 'But I don't think so. This feels real to me.'\n\n'Me too,' she said. \n\n...\n\nFour months later\nA few months later, Kate was thinking about the beginning of their relationship. She had to admit, nothing could ever be as perfect as those first days together. Real life had to start again. She got a job a few days after the trial ended. Michael went back to the library and his books and research projects. She didn't have to worry about money any more but they could no longer spend all day, every day together. They were no longer at that exciting stage of falling in love. But they saw each other when they could and they met each other's parents. Everyone expected them to get married. When he finally asked her to marry him, she felt that old excitement again.\n\n...\n\nThree years later\n'I really don't have time for this!' Kate shouted. She hated doing the weekly shopping. Why couldn't he do it? \n\n'Fine, I'll go then,' she said, closing the door hard so that it made a loud noise.\n\nKate felt as if these kinds of arguments were happening more often. As she walked around the supermarket, she thought about how they'd been before, when they were in love. 'Can it ever feel like that again?' she wondered. \n\nWalking into the health section, she recognised a word on a box of medicine. Limeren. The vitamin's name reminded her of a special time, a time when she was really crazy about Michael. She picked up a box and put it in her basket. \n\n...\n\nWhen she got home, Michael was already in bed so she ate dinner alone, taking her Limeren with a big glass of water. The next morning, she woke up early as usual, but instead of jumping straight in the shower, she joined Michael downstairs for breakfast.  \n\n'Good morning!' she said. To her surprise, she suddenly wanted to kiss him on the cheek. So she did, and sat down next to him at the table. He was eating in front of a big pile of books, looking cute with a pen behind his ear. 'What are you doing?'\n\n'I'm applying for money for my next research project,' he said. \n\n'Oh, good luck! What's the project about?' \n\nAfter breakfast, she thought how nice it had been to see him talking about something he cared about. She'd forgotten how cute his dimples were when he smiled, she thought. Or maybe she hadn't seen him smile much recently. Anyway, she decided to have breakfast with him every day, since it had been such a lovely start to the day. It couldn't hurt to make a bit more effort, could it?\n\n...\n\nTwo years later\nThe baby hadn't stopped crying for two hours, but now her little face was peaceful as she slept. Kate felt annoyed. Where was Michael? She went downstairs and found him filling bottles with milk for the baby.\n\n'Well done!' Michael said. 'That didn't sound easy.' \n\n'No!' she said angrily. 'It isn't!'  \n\n'You're doing an amazing job,' he said. 'OK, so, I've washed all the clothes, made your lunch for later and I'm going to come home early this afternoon so that you can have some time for yourself.' \n\nKate managed to smile and say thank you. He really was being very sweet, even if she was too tired to feel grateful or to be nice back. As soon as he had left for work, she picked up the box of Limeren. By the time he came home, Kate felt able to smile back when he smiled at her. \n\n \n\nOne year later\nKate was putting clothes away while the baby slept. She picked up one of Michael's favourite jumpers and held the soft material next to her cheek. She missed him and he had only been out an hour. Putting it back, she noticed something hard under the rest of the jumpers in the drawer. It was boxes and boxes of Limeren. \n\nThey weren't hers! She was shocked to see these boxes. She took Limeren every day, it was true, but Michael? She thought of Limeren as an easy way to those feelings she'd always had for Michael. And it was working. Every day she felt madly in love with her wonderful husband. Everyone said marriage was hard work, but she just didn't have time or energy for the job of marriage as well as her part-time job and a young baby. When she took Limeren, she made more effort to do small things that made their life together enjoyable. If he did something nice for her, she said thank you, but most of all she actually felt grateful. If he wore a new shirt or his hair looked good, she told him he was handsome. She asked him about his day and remembered things that were important to him. She'd seen nothing wrong with doing this. Until now, that is. Now she knew why he had always been so good at doing those same things for her. It was all fake!\n\nInstead of smiling at Michael when he got home, she was angry. Clearly the Limeren only had a limited ability to make everything perfect because nothing felt perfect right now.\n\n'What are all these?' she asked. She pointed to the Limeren packets she'd taken from the drawer and put on the kitchen table. \n\nMichael moved closer and tried to read the small writing on the boxes. 'They're vitamins, aren't they?'\n\n'Don't act as if you've got no idea why I'm asking!' said Kate, even more angry. 'These boxes,' she said, picking one of the packets up, 'are our relationship.'\n\n'Oh!' he said. 'It's Limeren!' \n\n'Yes, it's Limeren,' she said. 'I know exactly what they are.'\n\nHe looked confused. 'So why are you asking me what they are? I remember the name now you've said – from the place we met, right? – but I've not taken those for years.'\n\n'What?' \n\n'I just ... I don't know. It's better to get vitamins from fruit and vegetables, isn't it?' he said. 'The research company sent us boxes and boxes of them years ago, but I put them away somewhere and forgot to throw them away. We eat a healthy enough diet so there's no need to take vitamins.'\n\n'What about ...' She felt her voice getting louder and louder, but also something made her feel less sure about the words she planned to say. Her idea sounded stupid. 'What about the falling in love part? The side effects! You're always so wonderful, the perfect husband. And now I know why!'\n\n'Er ... thanks?' He laughed. 'I know they told us there were some side effects, but we were just joking when we said we fell in love because of the medicine, weren't we? Also,' he added, turning the box over in his hands, 'they must have changed the ingredients or something because it doesn't say anything on the box about side effects. See?' He held it out for her to look. 'Maybe they changed the recipe after we did that trial. Who knows?'\n\nHe gave her a big hug. 'This perfect husband is all natural, don't worry.'\n\nHe went upstairs to kiss the baby and then she heard him in the kitchen as he started to make dinner. She looked carefully at the boxes and it was true. There was nothing on the box about side effects, or even on the information inside. They were just vitamins after all. Limeren wasn't an easy way to love and it never had been.",

    "content": "Someone knocked at her door just as Victoria was about to leave her flat. It was strange because she hadn't heard the lift or anyone on the stairs. She quickly tried to put on her other shoe and nearly fell over. There were many unopened letters – probably asking for money – on the floor. She was late to work for the third time this month and now she had a visitor. Great, she thought.\n\nShe opened the door and tried to smile in a way that would say 'I'd love to talk, but sorry I can't!'\n\n'And how are you today, Victoria?' the man at her door asked. 'Good, I hope! If not, I bring you an eternity of warmth and best wishes from the wonderful director of my company.'\n\nVictoria's smile disappeared. How did he know her name? \n\n'You know how I can be so sure?' he asked. 'I am the wonderful director of my company!'\n\n'I'm sorry,' said Victoria. 'I really have to go. I'm late for work.' \n\n'Time!' He sounded sad. 'That's what they all want. Time or happiness, which one would you like more of?'\n\n'Listen, really,' said Victoria, 'I'm not interested, sorry.' \n\n'We've got a special offer on,' he replied. 'Twenty-five years of extra life in exchange for eternity. Or,' he smiled, 'double your happiness for the same price.'\n\n'Price?' she repeated, confused.\n\n'There are no hidden charges. We take everything you have – forever.'\n\nVictoria thought it was strange that he was wasting time on such a stupid joke. 'Then I want fifty extra years or four times more happiness,' she joked back.\n\n'Oh, you could,' he said. 'But I have to tell you, the quality of the years goes down after twenty-five. I recommend choosing happiness.'\n\nHe pushed the lift button for her. Of course, it was obvious that she was going down because it was morning and she was dressed for work. OK, so her smart bag only had sandwiches in, not important papers, and her suit was second-hand. One day, she'd think of a job she was good at and that paid well. \n\nSometimes Victoria felt as if her sister was the only lucky one in the family. Charlotte had her own prize-winning company and she was married to the handsome and funny Peter. The only thing wrong with Peter was that he didn't have a twin for Victoria to marry! Even the way Charlotte met Peter sounded like a film. After a lot of bad luck, Charlotte was in a car accident. At first, the doctors said she would never walk again but then, a new doctor, Peter, started work at the hospital. With Peter's help, Charlotte was walking again in just a few weeks. Even he joked that no one had known he was such a good doctor before he met Charlotte. He asked her to marry him two months later. Half a year after the accident, Charlotte started her company and now they lived in the most expensive part of London. Victoria was happy for her sister, of course, and she loved visiting their house and seeing their beautiful children, Gabriella and Angela. But sometimes it made her feel bad that she didn't have any good luck for herself.\n\nRemembering Charlotte's accident made her think. It was impossible to know what might happen in the future. 'But what if I get killed by a bus tomorrow?'\n\n'Then your perfect life will only last one day. Time or happiness, I can only offer one. I can't do miracles. Another company does those.' \n\n'Well, maybe you should change jobs,' she said and pressed the lift button herself.  \n\n'No,' he said. 'I've tried working for them. Their sales team makes a very different offer: Have a hard life now, then be happy for eternity. Some customers like the idea but, honestly, it's much harder to sell it.'\n\nThe lift wasn't even moving so she turned towards the stairs. She was going to be so, so late to work. But, as she started down the stairs, she suddenly remembered something.\n\n'Oh no!' she said. 'Gabriella and Angela!' Her little nieces' birthday presents were still sitting on the kitchen table. There wasn't time to go back and get them now. \n\n'It's time you want, isn't it, Victoria? I always know,' he called after her.\n\n'I don't believe these stupid things you're saying and I don't have time to talk to you!'\n\nShe stopped talking because she realised she was admitting that she needed more time. Then she screamed as he slid down the banister and suddenly appeared in front of her, floating in the air with his arms and legs crossed.\n\n'Aha!' he said. 'You want happiness instead!' \n\nVictoria moved backwards and put her hand against the wall so she wouldn't fall. Now she knew who the strange man was.\n\n'I'm happy enough, thanks,' she said, starting to run down the stairs. \n\n'Are you happy, Victoria?' he asked as he continued to slide down the banister with her. 'Of course, your job is not bad. You don't mind that the pay is low and your boss hates you because you're always late. I'm sure you'll find the money to pay your rent, just like you usually do.'\n\n'You can't know that!' she shouted. 'Anyway, money doesn't buy happiness!'\n\n'True, Victoria, true. It's love that makes the world go round.'\n\n'Exactly!' she said. Five more floors to go. \n\n'I'm sure one day you'll meet someone ...' he said.\n\n'I don't need a man to be happy, so if that's all you're offering ...'\n\n'You're so clever, Victoria,' he continued. 'So few people understand that happiness comes from inside us, not from things we can buy or from other people. I see that you're cleverer than many of our customers. Twenty-five years extra then. I can see it in you, Victoria. You won't waste them.'\n\n'But twenty-five more than what?'\n\n'No, no, no.' He turned the last corner with her. 'I won't tell you how long your life is. We've tried it with customers and it doesn't work. When people know how long they are going to live, they don't enjoy their lives.'\n\n'I don't believe in any of this. Or in you!'\n\nHe jumped off the banister and held up something small and white.\n\n'Your sister didn't believe it either,' he said. 'Not until she had her accident. Here's my card if you change your mind.'\n\nAnd he disappeared. Victoria was alone on the stairs, her mouth open in shock.",

    "content": "Plan 1: Guerrilla gardening\nThe time is what the army call 'oh-three-hundred-hours' – three o'clock in the morning. We're in the car park of the sports centre. It's empty except for me and my best friend, Janey and an old truck. It belongs to the company that put grass on the town football pitch last week.\n\n'What are we doing here?' I ask.\n\n'Here's the plan,' says Janey. 'First, we take that truck ...'\n\n'I'm going home,' I say. 'Good night.'\n\n'Then, we drive to the Town Hall. And then we use the grass in the truck to cover the high street from top to bottom. Like one great big garden. Are you ready?'\n\nI think about it for a moment. Then I smile.\n\n'OK,' I say. 'Let's go.'\n\n...\n\nOur new green high street is beautiful. But we don't have time to enjoy it. The judge says we committed a crime. She gives me 150 hours of community service. Janey gets 300 hours because it was her idea.\n\nI do my hours and return to my studies. Janey spends her time planning how we're going to do our guerrilla gardening better in future. We want to make the whole town green. Janey's ideas will probably put us both in prison. But someone has to help the planet.\n\nPlan 2: The bamboo forest\nEvery September, our town has a festival. Crowds of happy people eat hotdogs and wave little flags. Then everyone goes to the park on the edge of town. The mayor gives a speech, and everyone has fun. \n\nI should be at home packing my bags to go and study engineering at university. But, as soon as everyone has gone to the park, Janey picks me up in another 'borrowed' truck. This one is full of soil.\n\n'Get in,' she says. 'There's enough soil to cover the high street from Baker's Street to Humber Road, right past the new shopping centre. I've mixed it with bamboo seeds. It's a kind of seed that grows really, really fast. Before the festival is over, there will be a mini forest in front of the supermarket. No one will be able to get in or out of that street. It really does grow that fast. What do you think?'\n\nWell … why not? I'll be at university next week anyway. 'Let's do it.'\n\n...\n\nJaney was right, bamboo grows fast. It was as high as your knees before anyone discovered what we had done. By the time the council found someone to cut it down, our bamboo forest was taller than the mayor.\n\nIt was great, but they took it away. After what we did last year, they knew it was us. Plus, Janey had bought the bamboo online with her bank card, so it was definitely her. This time, she got six months in prison.\n\nShe didn't tell them I had helped her, so I still went to university. But I changed my degree to Agriculture and Wildlife. I wanted to learn all about plants, gardening and farming. I thought it would help Janey and me succeed as guerrilla gardeners.\n\nPlan 3: The vertical farm\nI'm wearing my new business suit. My presentation is ready, and there's a small plastic model of my idea on the table. On the other side of the table, my three heads of department are waiting to see my final university project – the vertical farm.\n\nWe've seen what happens when we do what Janey says. Now it's my turn.\n\n'Good morning,' I say. 'During my studies I've learned a lot about city farming. After university, I want to do something with what I've learned.'\n\nI show them the model. 'This is the high street of my town. This is our shopping centre, and this is an old, nine-floor car park. No one has used it for the last two years and it's now for sale.'\n\nI start the presentation. They can see my designs on the big screen while I talk.\n\n'I've designed a city farm using the carpark building. There will be eight floors to farm fruit and vegetables. This design will collect rainwater to water the soil. And we will use energy from the sun to power the special growing lights.'\n\nThe presentation changes to show the maths of how the farm will make money.\n\n'I will rent the space to small local farmers. We will sell everything in local shops to be as good for the environment as possible. Also, the ninth floor will be for any local people who want to grow their own food.'\n\nMy audience looks interested, but I haven't finished yet.\n\n'To prove the project can work, I've talked to local people and farmers. I've received letters of support and interest from all sides. I also gave this presentation to my bank manager. The bank will give me money, - if I can convince the town council to sell me the site.'\n\nI turn off the presentation. 'Are there any questions?'\n\n...\n\nMy project gets the highest marks in my class. But in the real world that doesn't matter. \n\nThe town council didn't accept my plan. Instead, they decided to sell the site to a company who will destroy the car park and build a block of luxury apartments. The mayor says they will bring new energy to the town. So that's the end of the vertical farm.\n\nJaney kept getting in trouble while I was away. But she was out of prison when I came back, so I met her for a drink. \n\n'You should never have changed from my way of doing things,' she tells me. 'Nothing sends our message better than covering streets with grass, trees and plants.' \n\nHer latest trip to prison was for doing exactly that, again. But I have just finished university and my future looks good. \n\nDo you think I was clever enough not to listen to her?\n\nPlan 4: Guerrilla gardening 2.0\nThis time, I agreed to do part of what Janey wanted. \n\nWe drive around town to search for the perfect location. Not in front of the Town Hall or the shopping centre. They are the kinds of places Janey thinks will send the biggest message. But I don't think these are the best places to choose.\n\nI'm looking for something different. Somewhere that's not in the town centre. Not the best neighbourhood, but a poor one. One that never gets any public money. One where the road is full of holes and the pavement is all broken. I'm looking for somewhere where people don't have cars outside their houses.\n\nWe find the perfect place.\n\nOne night, we arrive in another 'borrowed' truck. We carefully fill the whole street with soil from one pavement to the other. It's just like Janey's old plans, but this time we plant vegetable gardens in front of every house. We post letters through people's doors with gardening instructions, so the new lucky owners will know what to do. The letters also mention how much money you can save if you grow your own food – you'd be surprised.\n\nIn the same neighbourhood, we put grass over those broken old pavements for the kids to play on. Finally, we put up a sign that says, 'Please Walk on the Grass'.\n\nWhen we've finished, we're both covered in soil and completely exhausted. But Janey puts an arm around my shoulders and smiles. \n\n'Not a bad plan, for you,' she says. 'You're learning!'\n\n...\n\nThe people from the town council are extremely angry, of course. They send workers to the street to take it all away. But the people who live there join their arms together to protect their new gardens. Can you believe it? \n\nJust as I hoped, the people in this neighbourhood like what we've done to their street!\n\nLater that day, the mayor goes to the area to explain that what we did is a crime. He isn't very pleased when a local TV reporter arrives. \n\nThe reporter asks him, 'The town council hasn't spent any money on this street for 20 years! Now someone else has come and improved it! Why don't you want it to be a place for growing food? Why can't it be a place for children to play and learn?'\n\nIt was the main story on the national evening news, and the whole town was delighted. Well, everyone apart from the mayor, of course.\n\nThe night after that, Janey and I do it again, but this time we work fast and hard. We just leave big piles of soil, seeds and instructions on as many streets as we can.\n\nPeople get the idea now, and we can't do all the work ourselves.\n\nWe manage three more nights of that before the police catch us.\n\nPlan 5: The right place to fight\nSo here I am, in prison.\n\nIt could be worse. The plan was mainly my idea, but I don't have to stay here too long. That's because it's my first time in prison. Or it's my first time as an adult, at least. But Janey has been in prison many times now, so she gets longer. When I get out of prison, she will still have two years left. She doesn't mind too much. She's happy that 'Guerrilla Gardening 2.0' was successful.\n\nWe're in separate buildings in prison, but we both work on the prison farm. I start teaching Janey some of what I learned at university. Soon she has learned everything I can teach her. \n\nWhen it's time for me to get out of prison, we say goodbye.\n\nJaney says, 'Don't worry. I'll look after the farm. When you get sent back here for your next green crime, it'll be waiting for you!'\n\nBut my next plan does not include returning to prison.\n\n...\n\nDo you remember those piles of soil we left in streets all over town? Half of them are vegetable gardens now. The council doesn't like it, but we chose our locations well. The people that live there are really happy. And politicians don't want to take away gardens from happy people. If they do that, people will remember at election time. \n\nOne thing I've learned is this: \n\nIf you want to win the battle, choose the right place to fight.\n\nThe old mayor is retiring this year, you see. So the next time I try to re-green my town, I'll enter the election for the job of town mayor.\n\nLast year I was a guerrilla gardener. \n\nNext year I'll be the mayor. And our town will be the greenest place in the country.",

    "content": "Joanna Paresi was the last one left – the last living person in a family who had been market traders for hundreds of years. She was born in a village at the bottom of high mountains, and she had lived there all her life. At the top of the mountains, the stone fruit grew. In autumn, the fruit fell down the mountains. Most of the stone fruit got lost and no one could find them again. But some fruit fell into a small valley. Joanna's family were the only people who knew about the valley.\n\nWhen the stone fruit fell from the trees, they were black and hard. It took four long months for them to become ripe. They turned from black to grey and, finally, to silver. Then people could enjoy the sweet, sun-coloured fruit inside. \n\nWhen it was ripe, the stone fruit was delicious. It was the most popular food in the region. On market day, people got up early and queued for hours to buy it. Joanna's family always had more fruit to sell than anyone else. Her family had made a lot of money by selling the fruit over the years. But they were not as rich as the market sellers who sold their products far away in the capital city. \n\nWhen Joanna was a child, she asked her mother, 'Why don't we go to the capital city to sell the fruit? That's where the most important market in the country is.' Her mother told her that someone had tried once, and they had failed. But she didn't say any more. \n\nAs the years passed, Joanna dreamed of selling stone fruit at the market in the capital. The spring after her mother died, she decided to go. It would take four long months to walk to the capital city. It was exactly how long it took the fruit to become ripe. It would be difficult … but it was possible.\n\nWhen the people in the city tried stone fruit for the first time, they would love it. And, best of all, they would pay a lot. She would earn more money than ever before. \n\n*****\n\nJoanna walked all the way to the capital city. She pushed a wooden cart full of stone fruit. She carried with her a beautiful wooden market stall. The stall had belonged to her mother, and before that to Joanna's grandmother. On this stall, she would sell her fruit. When she finally arrived at the city, she was very tired after months on the road. But the stone fruit were almost ripe. So far, her plan was working.\n\nOf course, there was a tax to enter the city gates. And there were market fees to pay. Plus, it wasn't easy to sell strange, new foods like hers at the market. The fruit had to be tested to prove it was safe to eat. The tests were not cheap and they took days to do.\n\nJoanna spent all her money on the tests. And she also needed a place to sleep while she waited. She really needed money, so she sold her beautiful family stall. She didn't want to do it, but she had no choice. After she sold the fruit, she could buy the stall back.\n\nFinally, the tests were finished and she was allowed to sell her fruit. She used the last of her money to rent a cheap, ordinary stall. But by now the perfect, silver stone fruit had turned white and lost their sweet flavour. \n\nNo customers wanted to buy her overripe fruits from her boring stall. They were starting to look and smell bad. In the end, she sold all the stone fruit to a farmer to feed his pigs. He bought her cart too, and paid her much less than its value.\n\nShe had lost everything.\n\nJoanna left the market in defeat. She walked through the city streets. There were shops of every kind. In one she saw the beautiful stall that her mother had given her. But she had no money to buy it back.\n\nTears ran down her face, and she walked until she was lost in the city streets. At last, she lay down in a corner and fell asleep.\n\n*****\n\nWhen Joanna woke again, it was dark. But there was something even darker on the wall opposite her. It was a hole in the wall.\n\nIt wasn't a door, because it didn't reach the ground. It wasn't a window either. This was just a hole in the wall. It had … nothing. Just like her.\n\nJoanna felt so angry – with the market and with herself. She pulled off one of her boots. It was full of holes from her long journey. She threw it across the street at the hole.\n\nIt disappeared into the hole, but there was no sound as it landed. The boot was gone. It was just one more thing that she had lost by being stupid. Tired and sad, she closed her eyes on the world. But then she heard a sound.\n\nShe opened her eyes again.\n\nThere was something shiny on the ground. It was a coin – a single penny. It was enough to buy a meal. It was definitely worth more than her old boot.\n\nIt must be a joke, she thought. She waited for someone to come out and start laughing at her. But nothing happened. She pulled off her other boot and threw it after the first. She saw it fly through the hole into nothing. But this time she saw another coin fly back out, then a second and a third.\n\nJoanna picked up the nearest coin. She held it close to her face … It was real!\n\nShe picked up the other coins: three pennies. She could buy new boots now. \n\nShe took off her belt and threw it at the hole. In it went – and more coins flew back out. She picked those up too and counted them: ten pennies. Enough for new boots and a simple belt!\n\nExcited, she quickly took off her travelling coat, her jacket and both socks. She threw each one into the hole. \n\nWhen the sound of metal falling on the ground ended, she had a small pile of coins. She counted them, over and over, through the rest of the night.\n\nWhen morning came, the hole in the wall had disappeared. Perhaps she had lost her mind as well as her fruit, her cart and her mother's stall. \n\nFine. She didn't care. She had thirty-eight pennies.\n\nAnd if you're a good trader, all you need is somewhere to start.\n\n*****\n\nJoanna was now a very unusual trader. She had no shoes, socks or coat. She went from shop to shop. With her pile of pennies, she bought:\n\na large bag;\n\na long shirt;\n\na pair of broken wooden shoes;\n\nall the old, broken or useless things the other traders would sell her. \n\nWhen she had spent all her money, Joanna returned to the street where she had spent the night. All day she sat there, looking at the empty wall opposite. People walked past her. Some felt sorry for her. Others wondered what she was doing. But most people didn't pay her any attention. \n\n*****\n\nIn the middle of the night, the hole in the wall appeared again. Joanna was happy that she hadn't imagined it.\n\nShe opened the empty bag in front of the hole. Then, one by one, she threw things into the hole. Even the wooden shoes went in. The only thing she didn't throw in was the bag. When the sun rose in the morning, the bag was full and heavy with coins.\n\n*****\n\nJoanna bought new clothes with the money: a good hat, shirt and trousers, boots to take her home, a thick coat for winter in the mountains, and a new, bigger bag. She had enough money left to do some shopping at the market too. She bought silk carpets, fine wool, bags of spices and more. \n\nAfter a busy day, she returned to one, special shop. There she bought back her mother's stall. And then she went back to her lucky street with all the beautiful things she had bought at the market. \n\nShe sat down for one last night, waiting for the hole.\n\nWhen the hole appeared again, she started throwing the spices into it. Then she threw the wool and silk and the other things. Silver and gold coins flew out of the hole into the bag. Soon her bag was filled with more money than she had ever known. For a moment, she thought about throwing her family stall into the hole as well. But then she had a better idea. \n\nThe hole had always given her more than the value of the things she threw into it. So what about the gold and silver coins? What would the hole give her if she threw all the money in? \n\nWhat could be worth more than all the money she had?\n\nMaybe she would never have to sell stone fruit again! Joanna lifted the heavy bag of coins. She began to move the bag backwards and forwards, faster and faster … and then she threw it.\n\nFive coins came out of the bag and fell by Joanna's feet. The others flew into the hole.\n\nJoanna waited and watched the hole. But this time, nothing came back.\n\n*****\n\nThere was a tax to leave the city. Joanna's last five coins were just enough to pay it.\n\nShe walked out in her good boots and new clothes. On her back, she carried her mother's stall. She walked all day and she slept well at night. She was happy to be going home. As she got further and further away from the capital, she could see the mountains of home. They looked more beautiful than ever.\n\nHer pockets were empty, but her heart was full.\n\nSometimes she met other travellers on the road. When she saw them coming, she put up her beautiful, family stall. The only thing she had to sell was her story. She only asked people to pay a penny or two to hear her story. If they didn't have any money, she asked for some food or drink. No one believed her story was true, but they believed the lessons her story contained. Everyone who heard the story learned a different lesson. For some people, the lesson was 'be happy with what you have' or 'if you want more than you need, you will lose everything.' For others, it was 'wisdom has a high price.'\n\nFor Joanna, the last trader in her family, the lesson was different. It was the answer to her question: What could be worth more than all the money she had? Now she knew the answer was wisdom. ",

    "content": "September 17\nPriya and the plumber from TimeTech Insurance company looked around at her flooded kitchen. She hadn't been to the house for weeks. A few months ago, she had moved back to live with her parents to save money because Charlie's hospital bills were so high. She had hoped to sell the house before this but, so far, no one had been interested. Someone was coming to see it tomorrow, the first person in four months. She really needed them to buy it, but no one would want it now. She guessed the water had been in the kitchen for ages because it smelled like old fish. \n\n'Eww!' said Charlie at the horrible smell. He held his nose and made a silly face, the way five-year-olds do. And then he started to cough. But his thin body was too weak for the effort and he stopped. Priya felt even worse about the situation. \n\nShe had called the plumber as soon as she saw the condition of the house. And right after that, she called her boss at the jewellery shop to say she couldn't work today. She was really good at her job and she sold lots of jewellery, but he would probably take money from her pay. Just one of those expensive necklaces would pay for Charlie's operation. It was so unfair! \n\n'Do you mind if I look?' asked the plumber. \n\n'Of course! Please, go in,' she replied. Luckily, the plumber was wearing boots that were about five centimetres higher than the water. He walked slowly towards the sink and opened the cupboard under it to look at the pipes. Then, he took a few photos of the flooded kitchen, one of them with her, Charlie and the dog in. Charlie made another silly face for the photo, which made him look even more pale and ill.\n\n'Can you fix it?' she asked. She didn't have the money to pay someone to repair the kitchen, so she hoped the insurance company would do it. But TimeTech's slogan promised: Say goodbye to every* problem you ever had! Well, Priya definitely wanted to say goodbye to this problem.\n\n'It's your lucky day,' he said, 'as long as the flood happened within the right time period. Now, to be sure, I need to go back two months. The pipe looks as if it's been like this for a while. But I think the flooding actually happened six weeks ago because of the way the water looks.'\n\nPriya shook her head in surprise. It was so hard to believe that this time travel stuff was real.\n\n'Now, I just need to ask a few questions,' he said. He had a pen and paper to make notes, not some complicated machine like you might expect a time traveller to have. 'When did you sign up with TimeTech?'\n\n'August 15,' she said. Her heart sank the moment the words were out of her mouth.\n\n'Oh,' he said. 'That's only a month ago.'\n\n'Oh no! Please don't say you can't fix it! I need to sell the house or I can't pay for Charlie's doctor and—' She began to cry, she couldn't stop herself. 'I had to take the morning off work to come here today and my boss isn't happy. Now he won't pay me for today, which is all I need.'\n\n'We really can't go back to a time before the customer signed up with TimeTech,' he said, 'because it's really hard to make them believe that in the future they're going to be a customer. We tried it a few times but it always went badly.'\n\n'Oh, I'm sure I'll believe you! I was thinking about signing up for a long time before I finally did it,' she said. 'Say goodbye to every problem you ever had, right? I certainly have a lot of problems!' She tried to laugh but, instead, she was almost crying again. \n\nCharlie hugged her legs. Maybe the plumber felt sorry for her or maybe he was just embarrassed but he said, 'You seem as if you're having a hard time so, OK, I'll do this for you.'\n\nHe wrote down some more information, shaking his head. She knew that he was doing her a big favour. 'I'll be back in about half an hour to make sure you're happy with the work, OK?'\n\nThe plumber walked back to the road and disappeared into his van. It was a very ordinary van and it didn't look like a time machine at all. The slogan Say goodbye to every* problem you ever had! was painted on the side of the van. It had a * next to some smaller writing underneath, but she couldn't read it from where she was. \n\nObviously they couldn't wait in the disgusting, flooded kitchen so they sat outside. Charlie was too tired to run around the garden. Instead, he watched the dog trying to dig a hole next to the 'For Sale' sign. \n\nShe went closer to the van and read the small writing under the slogan. \n\n*TimeTech only solves problems involving objects. We CANNOT change situations that happen because of people and their actions.\n\nAaah, now she remembered! TimeTech had been in the news after twelve of their customers went to prison. TimeTech had now added * next to the word 'every' in their slogan. \n\nJust as she was looking at it, the van door opened. 'All fixed!' the plumber said, smiling. \n\n'Was I surprised to see you?' Priya asked. \n\n'Yes! At first, but that's why the photos are so useful. People always believe me when they see themselves in the pictures. You said you couldn't believe you were using TimeTech so soon after signing up.'\n\n'Let's see! Let's see!' Charlie jumped up and down with a new energy. \n\nPriya opened the house door and, just like TimeTech promised, her problem was solved. The kitchen was dry, tidy and smelled normal. \n\n'Wow!' said Charlie.\n\nPriya agreed. 'It's as though the flood never happened!' she said to the plumber.\n\nHe laughed. 'It didn't happen!' he said. 'I put your new pipe in on 17 July and that solved the problem before it could happen. It would be more accurate to say the flood unhappened! But don't think about it too much. Time travel is confusing!'\n\nPriya shook her head. She couldn't believe what had just happened – or unhappened. \n\nJuly 17\nTwo months earlier, Priya was also shaking her head and she also couldn't believe what had just happened. In one way, of course, nothing extraordinary had happened. \n\nA plumber had fixed a pipe in a few minutes. \n\nExcept the pipe wasn't broken – yet – and the plumber had come from the future. \n\nWell, she was glad that future Priya was going to sign up with TimeTech. She had heard a bit about them, but now she really understood what the company did. Say goodbye to every* problem you ever had! the slogan on the van outside her house had said. There was some smaller writing underneath, but she hadn't been close enough to read it. It was amazing – solve all your problems with time travel. She hadn't believed the plumber was telling the truth at first. But when he showed her the photo from the future she knew it was true. The photo showed Charlie looking so pale and thin. It broke her heart to see how much worse her little boy would get in the next two months.\n\n'I've certainly got a lot of problems,' she thought. The biggest was money, of course. Since Charlie had got ill, she had spent all her money on doctors and medicine. But he still needed an operation and if he didn't get it … She didn't want to think about it. She had very little time and she needed money, a lot of it. Until today, she thought selling the house and moving in with her parents was the only way to get enough money to make Charlie better. But now, thanks to TimeTech, she had a better idea. She knew stealing was wrong, time travel didn't change that. 'But my boss is horrible to me,' she thought. 'And anyway, he's so rich he won't notice if a couple of hundred-thousand-pound necklaces disappear. And if I do get caught, well, TimeTech will make it \"unhappen\" and get me out of prison.' Maybe they would help her put the jewellery back or go back in time and show her a photo of herself in prison, or whatever it was they could do. She'd seen her kitchen with her own eyes! TimeTech's insurance was the best insurance you could ever have.\n\nSeptember 17\nAs they waved the plumber goodbye, Charlie ran back into the garden. He played with the dog, who had found a ball in the kitchen. 'Where's the \"For Sale\" sign gone, Mum?' he asked. 'Did the plumber take it away?'\n\n'Something like that,' said Priya. She smiled as she watched him running around. His legs were strong and his little fat face was pink. \n\n'The operation was a success,' she thought. Her old worries were gone. But now that she had read the small writing on the TimeTech van, she had a new fear – that any moment the police would come and she would be the thirteenth person in prison. TimeTech couldn't solve every problem. She had been crazy to imagine they could. So far, it seemed as if her boss hadn't noticed the missing necklaces. She hoped her luck would last.",

    "content": "Steph was looking at Instagram. There were #blessed yoga photos and #SundayBreakfast pictures. She saw photos of fresh bread and coffee with hearts in the milk. \n\n*****\n\nOn the other side of the city, Matt was doing the same thing. His Instagram was full of #FitBody gym selfies and #beachlife holiday photos. \n\n*****\n\nSteph put some flowers next to her breakfast and took a photo of it. Her eggs and coffee were cold now, but the plate looked good. The plate was from an expensive art market. She had 'borrowed' the flowers from her neighbour's garden. Probably only ten people a day walked past old Mrs Robinson's garden. Flowers are for everyone to enjoy, aren't they? she thought. If she put the picture on Instagram, more people would see the flowers.\n\nSteph changed the colours on her picture to make the orange juice more orange and the pink roses brighter. She was choosing an Instagram filter when she noticed TrueBeauty. She had downloaded it the day before and then forgotten about it. Her picture looked perfect with that filter. She posted the photo for her 15k followers. She hoped some of them would feel jealous of her life. Then she threw the food on her plate into the bin. She didn't want to eat it now that it was cold. \n\n*****\n\nMatt was ready to give up. He had worked out for an hour and he had put cooking oil on his skin so that it would look shiny. But the photos still didn't look good. He only wanted to be fit so that he could put photos on social media. He looked at his Instagram again. He hoped to see some ideas he could copy. Then he noticed an ad for TrueBeauty. \n\nPictures as beautiful as you are. See the real you with TrueBeauty. Available in your app store for £0. Because True Beauty is free.\n\nThat's what he needed. He downloaded the app. In minutes, he had the perfect selfie. In the photos, his body looked amazing. He posted the photo for his 27k followers. Then he got in the shower to wash off all the cooking oil. He remembered reading about all the fat under the city, in the sewers. Millions of people lived in his city. Most of them washed their cooking oil down the sink. The oil went to the sewers. It made a disgusting mess and some poor worker had to clean it. Or did the oil go into the ocean and kill dolphins? He couldn't remember. But it wasn't his problem, was it? It was someone else's problem. \n\n*****\n\nBoth Steph and Matt were surprised to get so few likes. And they weren't prepared for the negative comments they received. \n\nsusieQ Remind me never to get breakfast at your place!\n\ngymguy21 Ewww, disgusting!\n\nThe rest of the comments were even worse.\n\nBoth social media influencers looked again at the pictures they had posted. \n\nSteph's picture showed horrible, green eggs with flies all over them. The flowers were dead, and the coffee looked disgusting and grey. In Matt's picture, his body was covered in something that looked like dirty butter. It was in his hair and in his nose. And, worst of all, his hands were really dirty. It looked as if he had been digging in the garden – or worse. \n\nThey both tried to delete the photos, but they couldn't. The negative comments kept coming. In a way, it was Steph's most popular post. And 50 people had shared Matt's post already. \n\nJust then, everyone who had installed the TrueBeauty filter received a message from the person who had created it. Steph and Matt read:  \n\nDear User,\n\nThank you for making TrueBeauty such an amazing success! Fifty million downloads in the first 24 hours! Wow, it's more than I ever hoped for. Honestly, guys, I am so #blessed.\n\nI know that each of you really, truly cares about showing yourself as you really are. Are you as beautiful on the inside as you are on the outside? If you want your pictures to show the real you, it's time to be as beautiful in real life as you are on your social media. \n\nHave a truly beautiful day, beautiful people!\n\nLove,\n\nTrueBeauty\n\nPS. You can't remove the filter or delete the pictures you posted using it. #SorryNotSorry \n\nPPS. By the way, after the first time you use TrueBeauty, it will change all your photos from that moment on! \n\n*****\n\nFor the next 24 hours, not many people posted photos online. There was only one way people could see if the filter was still destroying their photos: they had to post pictures first and then see how they looked.\n\nThe results were not pretty. \n\nA few of the biggest influencers offered a reward. They joined together to offer a million pounds for the first person to remove the filter. But they couldn't post a picture of themselves holding the money because the pictures were so ugly. So they had to stop advertising the reward. It didn't matter anyway. The person who developed TrueBeauty was too clever and no one could remove the filter. \n\n*****\n\nSteph stopped trying to take pictures after five more horrible pictures. She couldn't remove the TrueBeauty filter. The only thing she could do to hide the ugly pictures was to make her account private. Now, no one could see anything she had ever posted in her life. She felt depressed. She didn't want to do anything if she couldn't post photos of it.\n\nShe went downstairs, past Mrs Robinson's garden. The flowers were more beautiful than ever. She noticed the smell for the first time. Lovely! She stopped and smelled a large, purple rose. \n\n'Hello,' said Mrs Robinson. Steph was surprised because she didn't know Mrs Robinson was there. \n\n'Oh, sorry!' said Mrs Robinson. 'I was just putting water on the plants. At this time of year, there's always so much to do.'\n\nSteph looked around. She hadn't realised it was hard work to make a garden look nice. In fact, she had never really spoken to Mrs Robinson. She had a new thought.\n\n'Do you want some help?' Steph asked. After all, she didn't have anything else to do.\n\n'Oh, thank you, dear! That would be lovely!' Mrs Robinson looked delighted. Steph actually felt happy for the first time since the whole TrueBeauty nightmare had started.\n\nA couple of hours later, to be honest, Steph didn't think the garden looked very different. But Mrs Robinson said she had been a great help. Steph had enjoyed herself a lot. Mrs Robinson had been an actor in the past and she had some amazing stories to tell. \n\n'Take a picture of us, dear,' said Mrs Robinson as Steph was leaving. 'One of those selfies everyone loves.' \n\nSteph almost said no. What could she do with photos now? But Mrs Robinson would be happy with an ordinary picture. Steph supposed she could take one. She took a quick picture of the two of them. They were standing together in front of the roses, smiling and looking a little bit shiny and hot. \n\nLater that evening she looked at the picture on her phone. She changed the colours a little bit. But the roses looked beautiful anyway, with or without any changes. And nothing could improve the smiles on her and Mrs Robinson's faces. \n\nThat's a really beautiful picture, she thought. It's a shame TrueBeauty will destroy it if I post it. \n\nBut then she had a thought. She went back and read TrueBeauty's message again.\n\nAnd then she posted her picture. When the picture went online, it looked exactly the same! She made her account public again. Then she added some text to the photo. \n\nMe and my neighbour in her garden #TrueBeauty #BeautyIsOnTheInside \n\n*****\n\nOne of Steph's followers, Matt, saw her photo. At first, he was just pleased to see a nice photo for a change. He hadn't been to the gym for two days. He supposed he was kind of depressed. Maybe he felt bad because he hadn't exercised. Or maybe it was because of all the horrible, ugly photos he'd seen.\n\nThen he had an idea as he read @Steph's post. Maybe it wouldn't work, but it was worth trying. He picked up all the paper, plastic and glass in his house. He put it into three different piles. Then he looked again at @Steph's picture. He went and knocked on his neighbour's door. He asked her if he could take her rubbish to the bins. The young mother who answered the door was surprised at his offer of help, but she said yes.\n\n*****\n\nWhile Matt was at the recycling bins, he took a photo of himself next to the green glass bin. He posted the smiling selfie with the hashtag #TrueBeauty. He saw that #TrueBeauty was the fifth most popular hashtag. His picture, like many of the others, was nothing special. It was just a smiling guy, a guy who was doing something ordinary after helping his neighbour. It was a truly beautiful photo. ",

    "content": "This story takes place in Rome, where a Greek slave named Androcles escaped from his master and fled into the forest. There he wandered for a long time until he was weary and well nigh spent with hunger and despair. Just then he heard a lion near him moaning and groaning and at times roaring terribly. Tired as he was, Androcles rose up and rushed away, as he thought, from the lion; but as he made his way through the bushes he stumbled over the root of a tree and fell down lamed. When he tried to get up, there he saw the lion coming towards him, limping on three feet and holding his forepaw in front of him.\nAndrocles was in despair; he had no strength to rise and run away, and there was the lion coming upon him. But when the great beast came up to him instead of attacking him it kept on moaning and looking at him, he saw that the lion was holding out his right paw, it was covered with blood and much swollen.\n\nLooking more closely at it, Androcles saw a great big thorn pressed into the paw, which was the cause of all the lion's trouble. Plucking up courage he seized hold of the thorn and drew it out of the lion's paw, who roared with pain when the thorn came out, but soon after found such relief from it that he fawned upon Androcles and showed, in every way that he knew, to whom he owed the relief. Instead of eating him up, he brought him a young deer that he had slain, and Androcles managed to make a meal from it. For some time the lion continued to bring the game he had killed to Androcles, who became quite fond of the huge beast.\nBut one day a number of soldiers came marching through the forest and found Androcles. As he could not explain what he was doing, they took him prisoner and brought him back to the town from which he had fled. Here his master soon found him and brought him before the authorities. Soon Androcles was condemned to death for fleeing from his master. Now it used to be the custom to throw murderers and other criminals to the lions in a huge circus, so that while the criminals were punished the public could enjoy the spectacle of a combat between them and the wild beasts.\n\nSo Androcles was condemned to be thrown to the lions, and on the appointed day he was led forth into the Arena and left there alone with only a spear to protect him from the lion. The Emperor was in the royal box that day and gave the signal for the lion to come out and attack Androcles. But when it came out of its cage and got near Androcles, what do you think it did? Instead of jumping upon him, it fawned upon him and stroked him with its paw and made no attempt to do him any harm.\n \n\nIt was of course the lion which Androcles had met in the forest. The Emperor, surprised at seeing such a strange behavior in so cruel a beast, summoned Androcles to him and asked him how it happened that this particular lion had lost all its cruelty of disposition. So Androcles told the Emperor all that had happened to him and how the lion was showing its gratitude for his having relieved it of the thorn. Thereupon the Emperor pardoned Androcles and ordered his master to set him free, while the lion was taken back into the forest and let loose to enjoy liberty once more.",

    "content": "THERE WAS ONCE a very rich merchant who had three daughters; being a man of sense, he spared no cost for their education. His daughters grew to be very beautiful, especially the youngest, who was called Beauty, a special name that made her sisters very jealous of her.\nThe two eldest had a great deal of pride because they were rich. They gave themselves ridiculous airs, and would not visit other merchants' daughters, nor keep company with any but persons of quality. They went out every day to parties, balls, plays, concerts, and so forth, and they laughed at their youngest sister, because she spent the greatest part of her time in reading good books.\n\n \n\nSuddenly, all at once the merchant lost his whole fortune, accepting a small country house at a great distance from town, and told his children with tears in his eyes that they must go there and work for their living. The two eldest answered that they would never have to leave the town, for they had several prominent merchants who they were sure would be glad to have them, though they had no fortune. But the good ladies were mistaken, for their lovers slighted and forsook them in their poverty. As they were not liked on account of their pride, everybody said; they do not deserve to be pitied, we are very glad to see their pride humbled, let them go and give themselves quality airs in milking the cows and minding their dairy. But, added they, we are extremely concerned for Beauty, she is such a charming, sweet-tempered creature who speaks so kindly to poor people and has such a friendly, gracious nature.\nWhen they came to their country house, the merchant applied himself to farming and Beauty rose at four in the morning. Before the others stirred, she made haste to clean the house and prepare breakfast for the family. In the beginning she found it very difficult, for she had not been used to work as a servant, but in less than two months she grew stronger and healthier than ever. After she had done her work, she read, played on the harpsichord, or else sung while she spun yarn.\n\nOn the contrary, her two sisters did not know how to spend their time. They got up at ten and did nothing but saunter about the whole day, lamenting the loss of their fine clothes and acquaintance. \"Do but see our youngest sister,\" they snickered, one to the other, \"how well she's suited to a life of menial labor.\"\n\n \n\nThe family had lived about a year in the country house when the merchant received a letter with an account that a ship he thought had been lost at sea, that held on board dozens of bolts of cloth and silks he had purchased, had in fact safely arrived. The family rejoiced in the turn of their fortune. When the two eldest daughters saw their father ready to set out, one begged of him to buy her a new necklace of gems, and the other a thick golden chain, but Beauty asked only for a rose.\nThe good man set off on his journey. But when he came there, oh such problems there were over who properly owned the ship and the merchandise on board, and after a great deal of trouble and pains to no purpose, he came back as poor as before, especially after he bought the fine new necklace and gold chain he promised to his two older daughters. Thinking he might come upon a rosebush to satisfy the wish of his youngest daughter, he led his horse deep into the woods. As the sun set and the wind began to howl, the poor man realized he was hopelessly lost. What's more, with the rain and the snow he knew he might well starve to death with cold or hunger, or be devoured by the wolves, whom he heard howling all round him. Then in an instant, looking through a long walk of trees, he saw a light at some distance. Going on a little farther, he noticed it came from a place lit with candles from top to bottom.\n\n \n\nThe merchant hastened to the place, but was greatly surprised at not meeting anyone in the outer courts. His horse followed him, and seeing a large stable open, went in, and finding both hay and oats, the poor beast, who was almost famished, fell to eating very heartily. The merchant tied him up to the manger and walked towards the house, where he saw no one. Entering into a large hall, he found a good fire and a table plentifully set out. As he was wet quite through with the rain and snow, he drew near the fire to dry himself. \"I hope,\" said he, \"the master of the house, or his servants will excuse the liberty I take; I suppose it will not be long before some of them appear.\"\n\n \n\nHe waited a considerable time, until it struck eleven, and still nobody came.\n\n \n\nAt last he was so hungry that he could stand it no longer, but took a leg of chicken and ate it in two mouthfuls, trembling all the while. After this he drank a few glasses of wine. Growing more courageous, he went out of the hall and crossed through several grand apartments with magnificent furniture, until he came into a chamber. In the chamber was an exceedingly good bed, and as he was very tired and it was past midnight, he concluded it was best to shut the door and go to sleep.\n\nIt was ten the next morning before the merchant waked. As he was going to rise he was astonished to see a good suit of clothes laid out on the bed that would fit him perfectly. Certainly, said he, this palace belongs to some kind fairy, who has seen and pitied my distress. He then returned to the great hall where he had supped the night before, and found some chocolate ready made on a little table. \"Thank you, good Madam Fairy,\" said he aloud, \"for being so careful as to provide me a breakfast. I am extremely obliged to you for all your favors.\"\nThe good man drank his chocolate and then went to look for his horse, but passing through an arbor of roses he remembered Beauty's request to him, and gathered a branch on which were several. Immediately he heard a great crash like thunder, and looking around he saw a huge monster - two tusks in his mouth and fiery red eyes surrounded by bristles and horns coming out of its head and spreading over its back.\n\n \n\n\"Mortal,\" roared the beast, \"who told you you might pluck my rose?\"\n\n \n\n\"Please, sir,\" said the merchant in fear and terror for his life, \"I promised my daughter to bring her home a rose and forgot about it till the last moment, and then I saw your beautiful garden and thought you would not miss a single rose, or else I would have asked your permission.\"\n\"Thieving is thieving,\" said the beast, \"whether it be a rose or a diamond; your life is forfeit.\"\nThe merchant fell on his knees and begged for his life for the sake of his three daughters who had none but him to support them. \"My lord,\" said he, \"I beseech you to forgive me, indeed I had no intention to offend in gathering a rose for one of my daughters, who desired me to bring her one.\"\n\n \n\n\"You say you have daughters,\" replied the monster. \"I will forgive you, on one condition - that one of them come willingly and suffer for you. Swear that if any of your daughters refuses to die in your stead, you will return within three months and place yourself at my disposal.\"\n\nSo the merchant swore. Taking his rose, he mounted his horse and rode home.\n\nAs soon as he got into his house, his daughters came rushing round him, clapping their hands and showing their joy in every way. He gave the necklace to his eldest daughter, the gold chain to his second daughter, and then he gave the rose to his youngest, and as he gave it he sighed.\n\n\"Oh, thank you, father,\" they all cried.\n\nBut the youngest said, \"Why did you sigh so deeply when you gave me my rose?\"\n\n\"Later I will tell you,\" said the merchant.\nSo for several days they lived happily together, though the merchant wandered about gloomy and sad, and nothing his daughters could do would cheer him up till at last, pressed by his youngest daughter, he related his fatal adventure.\n\n \n\nImmediately the two eldest set up lamentable outcries, blaming poor Beauty, and said all manner of ill-natured things to her.\n\n \n\nBeauty spoke: \"Since the monster will accept one of his daughter,\" said she, \"I will deliver myself up to all his fury, and I am very happy in thinking that my death will save my father's life, and be a proof of my tender love for him.\"\n\n\"Beauty, I am charmed with your kind and generous offer,\" said the merchant, \"but I cannot let you do it. I am old and have not long to live, so can will lose only a few years, at the most.\"\n\"Indeed father,\" said Beauty, \"you shall not go to the palace without me, you cannot stop me from following you.\" Beauty insisted on setting out for the palace, and made the necessary preparations for herself, and her sisters were secretly delighted at the prospect of getting rid of her once and for all.\n\nSo next day the merchant took Beauty behind him on his horse, as was the custom in those days, and rode off to the dwelling of the beast. When he got there and they alighted from his horse the doors of the house opened, and what do you think they saw there? Nothing.\n\n \n\nSo they went up the steps and went through the hall into the dining room.\n \n\nThere they saw a table spread with all manner of beautiful glasses and plates and dishes and napery, with plenty to eat upon it. So they waited and they waited, thinking that the owner of the house would appear, till at last the merchant said, \"Let's sit down and see what happens then.\" When they sat down, invisible hands passed them things to eat and to drink, and they ate and drank to their heart's content. And when they arose from the table it arose too and disappeared through the door as if it were being carried by invisible servants.\n\nSuddenly the Beast filled the doorway. \"Is this your youngest daughter?\" he boomed.\n\nAnd when he had said that it was, the Beast said, \"Is she willing to stay here with me?\"\n\nThen he looked at Beauty who said, in a trembling voice, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n \n\n\"Well, no harm shall befall you.\" With that he led the merchant down to his horse and said to him, \"Honest man, go your ways tomorrow morning, but never think of coming here again.\" Then the Beast returned to Beauty and said to her, \"This house with all that is therein is yours; if you desire anything, clap your hands and say the word and it shall be brought to you.\" And with that he made a sort of bow and went away.\n\nSo Beauty lived on in the home of the Beast and was waited on by invisible servants and had whatever she liked to eat and to drink, but she soon got tired of the solitude. Next day, when the Beast came to her, though he looked so frightening, she had been so well treated that she had lost a great deal of her terror of him. So they spoke together about the garden and the house and her father's business and all manner of things, so that Beauty lost altogether her fear of the beast.\n\"Beauty,\" said the Beast, \"if my presence is troublesome, I will end our conversation and leavy you. For tell me, do not you think me very ugly?\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Beauty, \"for I cannot tell a lie, but I believe you are very good natured.\"\n\n \n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the Beast, \"my heart is good, but still I am a monster.\"\n\n \n\n\"Among mankind,\" says Beauty, \"there are many that deserve that name more than you, and I prefer you, just as you are, to those, who, under a human form, hide a treacherous, corrupt, and ungrateful heart.\"\nBeauty ate a hearty supper and had almost conquered her dread of the monster, but she nearly fainted away when he said to her, \"Beauty, will you be my wife?\"\n\nIt was some time before she dared answer, for she was afraid of making him angry if she refused. At last, however, she said trembling, \"No, Beast.\" Immediately the poor monster sighed, and then hissed so frightfully that the whole palace echoed. But Beauty soon recovered her fright, for Beast said in a mournful voice, \"then farewell, Beauty,\" and left the room.\n\nBeauty spent the next three months very contentedly in the palace. Seeing the Beast often had so accustomed her to his deformity, that, far from dreading the time of his visit, she would often look on her watch to see when it would be nine, for the Beast never missed coming at that hour. There was only one thing that gave Beauty any concern, which was that every night, before she went to bed, the monster always asked her, if she would be his wife. One day she said to him, \"Beast, you make me very uneasy, I wish I could consent to marry you, but I am too sincere to make you believe that will ever happen; I shall always esteem you as a friend, please try to be satisfied with this.\"\n\n \n\n\"I suppose I must,\" said the Beast, \"for, alas! I know too well my own misfortune. Though I ought to think myself happy that you will stay here; promise never to leave me.\"\n\nBeauty blushed at these words. \"I could,\" answered she, \"indeed, promise never to leave you, but I have so great a desire to see my father that I'm afraid I shall fret to death if you refuse me that satisfaction.\"\n\"Perhaps this will help,\" said the Beast. He handed her a handled looking-glass and in the round mirror was the image of Beauty's father, pining himself sick for the loss of her.\n\n \n\n\"Oh!\" she cried, and all the color rushed from her face.\n\n\"I would rather die myself,\" said the monster, \"than give you the least uneasiness. I will send you to your father. You may remain with him for one week, but if you do not return before the end of the week, poor Beast will die with grief.\"\n\n\"I give you my promise,\" said Beauty, \"to return in a week.\"\n\n\"You shall be there tomorrow morning,\" said the Beast. \"Take this magic looking-glass with you, and this ring. You need only to lay your ring on the mirror before you go to bed, when you have a mind to come back. Farewell Beauty.\"\nWhen Beauty waked the next morning, she found herself at her father's house. She quickly dressed and came to the kitchen, where her father gave a loud shriek and thought he would die with joy to see his dear daughter again. He held her fast locked in his arms over a quarter of an hour. As soon as the first transports were over, the father shared with Beauty the good news - both her sisters were married.\n\nBeauty sent for her sisters who hastened thither with their husbands.\n\n \n\nThey were both of them very unhappy.\n \n\nThe eldest had married a gentleman, extremely handsome indeed, but so fond of his own person, that he was full of nothing but his own dear self, and neglected his wife. The second had married a man of wit, but he only made use of it to plague and torment everybody, and his wife most of all. Beauty's sisters sickened with envy, when they saw her dressed like a princess, and more beautiful than ever, nor could all her obliging affectionate behavior stifle their jealousy, which was ready to burst when she told them how happy she was. They went down into the garden to vent it in tears; and said one to the other, in what way is this little creature better than us, that she should be so much happier? \"Sister,\" said the oldest, \"a thought strikes my mind. She told us of the promise to stay only for one week. Let us try to keep her beyond the week. Perhaps the monster will be so enraged for breaking her word that he will devour her.\"\n\n\"Right, sister,\" answered the other. They went back to the house and behaved so affectionately to their sister that poor Beauty wept for joy. When the week was expired, they cried and tore their hair, and seemed so sorry to part with her that she promised to stay a week longer.\nIn the meantime, Beauty could not help feeling uneasy that she was likely causing pain for poor Beast, whom she sincerely loved, and really longed to see again. The tenth night she spent at her father's, she dreamed of the Beast in the palace garden, suffering, maybe even dying, for loneliness for her. Beauty was startled from her sleep, sat up straight in bed, and burst into tears. \"Am I not very wicked,\" said she, \"to act so unkindly to Beast, who has tried so hard to please me in everything? Is it his fault if he is so ugly?  He is kind and good, and that is more than enough. Why did I refuse to marry him? I would be happier with the monster than my sisters are with their husbands; it is neither wit, nor a fine face, in a husband, that makes a woman happy, but virtue, sweetness of temper, and thoughtfulness, and Beast has all these valuable qualifications. Having said this, Beauty rose, put her ring on the mirror, and then laid down again; scarce was she in bed before she fell asleep, and when she waked the next morning, she was overjoyed to find herself in the Beast's palace.\n\nShe put on one of her richest suits, and waited for evening with the utmost impatience, at last the wished-for hour came, the clock struck nine, yet no Beast appeared. Beauty then feared she had been the cause of his death; she ran crying and wringing her hands all about the palace, like one in despair; after having sought for him everywhere, she remembered her dream and flew to the garden, where she had dreamed she saw him. There she found poor Beast stretched out, quite senseless, and, as she imagined, dead. She threw herself upon him and finding his heart beating still, she fetched some water from the canal and poured it on his head. Beast opened his eyes, and said to Beauty, \"You forgot your promise, and I was so afflicted for having lost you that I resolved to starve myself, but since I have the happiness of seeing you once more, I die satisfied.\"\n\n \n\n\"No, dear Beast,\" said Beauty, \"you must not die. Live to be my husband; from this moment I give you my hand, and swear to be none but yours. Alas! I thought I had only a friendship for you, but the grief I now feel convinces me that I cannot live without you.\"\n\nNo sooner had she said this than the hide of the beast split in two and out came a most handsome young prince. The prince told her that he had been enchanted by a magician and could not recover his natural form until a maiden would, of her own free will, declare that she loved him.\nThereupon the prince sent for the merchant and his daughters, and he was married to Beauty, and they all lived happily ever after.",

    "content": "A soft and fluffy Velveteen Rabbit lived in a toybox in a Boy's room.  Each day, the Boy opened the toybox and picked up Velveteen Rabbit. And Velveteen Rabbit was happy.\n \n\nThen newer, brighter toys came into the toybox.  They had special tricks.  Some could move when the Boy pushed a button.  Others bounced high. \n\nVelveteen Rabbit had no special tricks or buttons. No wonder the Boy started to choose these other new toys.  \n\nAt night, when the toys were back all in the toy box, the other toys talked with pride about the fine things they could do. Velveteen Rabbit was quiet.  There was not much to say.\n \n\nOnly one other toy in the toy box was like Velveteen Rabbit.  Cowboy Horse was also a soft, fluffy toy.  But he was old.  Most of his hair was worn away.\n\nCowboy Horse said to Velveteen Rabbit, “Soft toys like us are really the lucky ones.  We get loved the most.  And when soft toys get loved and loved, we can become Real.”\n“What is Real?” said Velveteen Rabbit.\n\n“Being Real is the best,\" said Cowboy Horse.  \"You can move when you want to move. When you are Real, if you are loved, you can show your love back.”\n \n\nOne day Nana, who took care of the Boy, flew open the lid of the toy box.  She said in a busy tone, “Oh, dear!  That walking doggie is missing. I must find something else for the Boy!”  In a second, Velveteen Rabbit was plopped down onto the bed with the Boy.\n\nThis began another happy time for Velveteen Rabbit.  Each night the Boy would hold Velveteen Rabbit close in his arms.  In the morning, the Boy would show Velveteen Rabbit how to make rabbit holes under the sheets.  If the Boy went outside to a picnic, or to the park, Velveteen Rabbit would come with him, too.  \nAfter awhile, with the hugging and holding, much of Velveteen Rabbit’s fur got matted down.  Its pink nose grew less pink with all the Boy’s kisses.  But Velveteen Rabbit did not care.  It was happy.\n\nOne day the Boy became sick.  His forehead got very hot.  The doctor came and went.  Nana walked back and forth in fear.  Day after day, the Boy stayed in bed.   There was nothing for Velveteen Rabbit to do but to stay in bed, too, day after day.  \n \n\nThen at last, the Boy got better.  Such joy in the house! The doctor said the Boy must go to the shore.  How wonderful! thought Velveteen Rabbit.  Many times the Boy had talked happily about the shore, and told of its white sands and big blue ocean.  \n\n“What about this old bunny?” Nana asked the doctor.\n\n“That old thing?” said the doctor.  “It’s full of scarlet fever germs.  Burn it at once!  Get him a new bunny.”\n\nSo Velveteen Rabbit was thrown into a sack along with the Boy's bed sheets and old clothes and a lot of junk.  The sack was carried to the backyard.  The gardener was told to burn the whole thing.\n\nBut the gardener was too busy with picking the beans and peas before nightfall, so he left the sack behind.  “I will take care of it tomorrow,” he said.  The sack was not tied at the top, and Velveteen Rabbit fell out. \n \n\nThe next day when the gardener picked up the sack to take it away to be burned, Velveteen Rabbit was not in it.\nThen it started to rain.  Velveteen Rabbit was sad.  So far away from the Boy, never again to be nice and cozy together, and now soaking wet!  A tear fell from Velveteen Rabbit’s eye, over his cheek.  It plopped onto the grass.\n\nAll at once, at the spot where the tear fell, a flower grew up.  Then the bud of the flower opened.  A tiny Fairy!\n \n\n“Little Rabbit,” said the Fairy.  “Do you know who I am?”\n\n“I wish I did,” said Velveteen Rabbit.\n\n“I am the Fairy that takes care of toys that are well loved,” said the Fairy.  \n\nBy then, Velveteen Rabbit was shabby and gray.  The boy had loved off all of its whiskers.  The pink lining in the ears had long turned grey. Its brown spots, once fresh and bright, were now faded and hard to see.\n“It is time now for me to make you Real,” said the Fairy.  \n\n“I think I remember Real,” said Velveteen Rabbit.  Now, what was it Cowboy Horse had said?  Ah yes.  When you are Real, you can move when you want to move.  If you are loved, you can love back.\n\nWith one touch of the Fairy’s wand, Velveteen Rabbit felt different.  Tickly.  All of a sudden, each one of its two legs sewn together tight, could move!  \nA fly landed on Velveteen Rabbit’s head and it was itchy.  As quick as a wink, that foot was up at the Velveteen Rabbit’s head to scratch it off. \n\n“So this is being Real\"! “I can move when I want to move!”\n\n“I will show you some new friends,” said the Fairy.  And the Fairy took Velveteen Rabbit where several rabbits ran and hopped about.  Soon they were all great friends.\n\nTime went by.  The Boy was back from the shore.  He was all better now. \n\nOne day, the Boy went to the backyard to play.  From the trees nearby, a few rabbits hopped out.  One rabbit was brown all over, and another one was all white.  A third rabbit had brown spots, most of them faded.  That one hopped the closest to the Boy.\n \n\nThe Boy thought, \"Why, this rabbit looks just like my old Bunny that was lost when I was sick.  I loved that Bunny!\"\n\nWhat he didn't know was that it was his very own Bunny, come back to see the boy. For he was the reason the Velveteen Rabbit had become Real.",

    "content": "ONCE UPON A TIME a girl named Cinderella lived with her stepmother and two stepsisters.  Poor Cinderella had to work hard all day long so the others could rest. It was she who had to wake up each morning when it was still dark and cold to start the fire.  It was she who cooked the meals. It was she who kept the fire going. The poor girl could not stay clean, from all the ashes and cinders by the fire.\n\n \n\n“What a mess!” her two stepsisters laughed.  And that is why they called her “Cinderella.”\nOne day, big news came to town.  The King and Queen were going to have a ball!  It was time for the Prince to find a bride. All of the young ladies in the land were invited to come.  They were wild with joy! They would wear their most beautiful gown and fix their hair extra nice. Maybe the prince would like them!\n\nAt Cinderella’s house, she now had extra work to do.  She had to make two brand-new gowns for her step-sisters.  \n\n“Faster!” shouted one step-sister.\n\n“You call that a dress?” screamed the other.  \n\n“Oh, dear!” said Cinderella.  “When can I–“\nThe stepmother marched into the room.  “When can you WHAT?”\n\n \n\n“Well,” said the girl, “when will I have time to make my own dress for the ball?”\n\n“You?” yelled the stepmother.  “Who said YOU were going to the ball?”\n\n“What a laugh!” said one step-sister.\n“Such a mess!” They pointed at Cinderella.  All of them laughed.\n\nCinderella said to herself, “When they look at me, maybe they see a mess.  But I am not that way.  And if I could, I WOULD go to the ball.”\n\nSoon the time came for the stepmother and step-sisters to leave for the big party.\n\n \n\nTheir fine carriage came to the door. The stepmother and step-sisters hopped inside.  And they were off.\n\n“Good-bye!” called Cinderella.  “Have a good time!” But her stepmother and step-sisters did not turn around to see her.\n“Ah, me!” said Cinderella sadly.  The carriage rode down the street.  She said aloud, “I wish I could go to the ball, too!”\n\nThen - Poof!\nAll of a sudden, in front of her was a fairy.\n\n“You called?” said the fairy.\n\n \n\n“Did I?” said Cinderella.  “Who are you?”\n\n“Why, your Fairy Godmother, of course!  I know your wish.  And I have come to grant it.”\n\n“But…” said Cinderella, “my wish is impossible.”\n\n“Excuse me!” said the Fairy Godmother in a huff.  “Did I not just show up out of thin air?”\n\n“Yes, you did,” said Cinderella.\n“Then let me be the one to say what is possible or not!”\n\n“Well, I think you know I want to go to the ball, too.” She looked down at her dirty clothes.\n\n “But look at me.”\n\n“You do look a bit of a mess, child,” said the Fairy Godmother.\n\n“Even if I had something nice to wear,\" said the girl, \"I would have no way to get there.\"\n\n“Dear me, all of that is possible,” said the Fairy. With that, she tapped her wand on Cinderella’s head. \n\nAt once, Cinderella was all clean.  She was dressed in a beautiful blue gown.  Her hair was set up high on her head inside a golden band.\n\n“This is wonderful!” said Cinderella.\n“Who said I was done?” said the Fairy Godmother.  She tapped her wand again. At once, a beautiful carriage came to be, with a driver and four white horses. \n\n“Am I dreaming?” said Cinderella, looking around her.\n\n“It is as real, as real can be,” said the Fairy Godmother.  “But there is one thing you must know.”\n\n“What is that?”\n\n“All of this lasts only to midnight.  Tonight, at the stroke of midnight, it will all be over.  Everything will go back to how it was before.”\n“Then I must be sure to leave the ball before midnight!” said Cinderella.\n\n“Good idea,” said the Fairy Godmother.  She stepped back. “My work is done.” And with that, the Fairy Godmother was gone.\nCinderella looked around her.  \"Did that even happen?\"  But there she stood in a fine gown, and with a golden band in her hair.  And there were her driver and four horses before her, waiting.\n\n“Coming?” called the driver.\n\nShe stepped into the carriage.  And they were off.\n\nOver at the ball, the Prince did not know what to think.  “Why do you have that sad look on your face?” the Queen said to her son.  “Look around you! You could not ask for finer maidens than these.”\n\n“I know, Mother,” said the Prince.  Yet he knew something was wrong. He had met many of the young women.  Yet after he said “hello,” one by one, he could find nothing more to say.\n\n\"Look!\"  Someone pointed to the front door.  “Who is that?”\n\nAll heads turned.  Who was that lovely maiden stepping down the stairs?  She held her head tall and looked as if she belonged. But no one knew her. \n\n“There is something about her,” said the Prince to himself.  “I will ask her to dance.” And he walked over to Cinderella.\n\n“Have we met?” said the Prince.\n\n“I am pleased to meet you now,” said Cinderella with a bow.\n\n“I feel as if I know you,” said the Prince.  “But of course, that is impossible.”\n“Many things are possible,” said Cinderella, “if you wish them to be true.”\n\nThe Prince felt a leap in his heart.  He and Cinderella danced. When the song was over, they danced again.  And then they danced again, and yet again. Soon the other maidens at the ball grew jealous.  “Why is he dancing all the time with her?” they said. “How rude!” \n\nBut all the Prince could see was Cinderella.  They laughed and talked, and they danced some more.  In fact, they danced for so long that Cinderella did not see the clock.\n\n“Dong!” said the clock.\n\nCinderella looked up.  \n\n“Dong!” went the clock again.  \n\nShe looked up again.  “Oh, my!” she cried out.  “It is almost midnight!”\n\n“Dong!” rung the clock.  \n\n“Why does that matter?” said the Prince.\n“Dong!” called the clock.\n\n“I must go!” said Cinderella.  \n\n“Dong!” went the clock.\n\n“But we just met!” said the Prince.  “Why leave now?”\n\n“Dong!” rung the clock.\n\n“I must GO!” said Cinderella.  She ran to the steps.\n\n“Dong!” said the clock.\n\n“I cannot hear you,” said the Prince.  “The clock is too loud!”\n\n“Dong!” rung the clock.\n\n“Goodbye!” said Cinderella. Up, up the stairs she ran.\n\n“Dong!” went the clock.\n\n“Please, stop for a moment!” said the Prince.\n\n“Oh, dear!” she said as one glass slipper fell off her foot on the stair.  But Cinderella kept running up.\n“Dong!” said the clock.\n\n“Please wait a moment!” said the Prince.  \n\n“Dong!” rung the clock.\n\n“Goodbye!” Cinderella turned one last time.  Then she rushed out the door.\n\n“Dong!”  The clock was quiet. It was midnight.  \n\n“Wait!” called the Prince.  He picked up her glass slipper and rushed out the door.  \n\nHe looked around but could not see her blue dress anywhere.  “This is all I have left from her,” he said, looking down at the glass slipper.  He saw that it was made in a special way, to fit a foot like none other. “Somewhere there is the other glass slipper,” he said.  “And when I find it, I will find her, too.  Then I will ask her to be my bride!”\n\nFrom hut to hut, from house to house, went the Prince.  One young woman after another tried to fit her foot inside the glass slipper.  But none could fit. And so the Prince moved on.\nAt last the Prince came to Cinderella’s house.  \n\n“He is coming!” called one step-sister as she looked out the window.\n\n“At the door!” screamed the other step-sister.  \n\n“Quick!” yelled the stepmother.  “Get ready! One of you must be the one to fit your foot in that slipper.  No matter what!”\n\nThe Prince knocked.  The stepmother flew open the door.  “Come in!” she said. “I have two lovely daughters for you to see.”\n\nThe first step-sister tried to place her foot in the glass slipper.  \nShe tried hard, but it just would not fit. Then the second step-sister tried to fit her foot inside.  She tried and tried with all her might, too. But no dice.\n\n“Are there no other young women in the house?” said the Prince.\n\n“None,” said the stepmother.\n\n“Then I must go,” said the Prince.\n\n“Maybe there is one more,” said Cinderella, stepping into the room.\n“I thought you said there were no other young women here,” said the Prince.\n\n“None who matter!” said the stepmother in a hiss.\n\n“Come here,” said the Prince.\n\nCinderella stepped up to him.  The Prince got down on one knee and tried the glass slipper on her foot.  \n\nIt fit perfectly! Then, from her pocket Cinderella took out something. It was the other glass slipper!\n\n“I knew it!” he cried.  “You are the one!”\n\n“WHAT?” shouted a step-sister.  \n\n“Not HER!” screamed the other step-sister.\n\n“This cannot BE!” yelled the stepmother.  \n\nBut it was too late.  The prince knew that Cinderella was the one.  He looked into her eyes. He did not see the cinders in her hair or the ashes on her face.\n\n“I have found you!” he said.\n\n“And I have found you,” said Cinderella.\nAnd so Cinderella and the Prince were married, and they lived happily ever after.",

    "content": "On a farm long ago, a Mama Duck sat on her nest.  “How long must I wait for my babies to hatch?” she said.  “I have to sit here all alone! And no one comes to visit me.”  But what could she do? A Mama duck must keep her eggs warm till they hatch.  \n\nAt last, the eggs began to crack.  One by one, yellow ducklings stepped out of their shells.  They shook their wings and said, “Quack, quack!”\n“Look at all of you!” said Mama Duck with joy.  “You are all so cute!”\n\n“Quack, quack!” they said.\n\nMama Duck said, “Come and line up.  We will go down to the lake for your very first swim.”  She counted – one, two, three, four, five. “Oh dear!” she said.  “I should have six ducklings!”\n\nBut one large egg was still in the nest. “Well,\" said Mama Duck, \"it looks like that big egg will take more time.” So she had to go sit on her nest again and wait some more. \n\nThe next day, the big egg started to hatch.  Out came a baby boy bird. But if one may say so, it was an odd-looking thing.  This bird was much bigger than others. He was not yellow at all - he was dark-gray from his head to his feet.  And he walked with a funny wobble.\n\nOne of the yellow ducklings pointed.  “What is THAT? He cannot be one of us!”\n\n“I have never seen such an ugly duckling!” said another.  \n\n“How can you say such a thing?” said Mama Duck in a stern voice. “You are only one day old!  Your brother hatched from the very same nest as you did. Now line up. We will go to the lake for your very first swim.”\n\nYet the other ducklings quacked, “Ugly!  Ugly! Ugly!” The Ugly Duckling did not know why the other ducklings were yelling at him.  He took the last spot in the line.\n\nEach yellow duck jumped in the river and swam behind Mama Duck.  When it was his turn, the Ugly Duckling jumped in and started to paddle, too.  “At least he can swim,” Mama Duck said to herself.\n\nWhen they left the water and started to play, the Ugly Duckling tried to play with his brothers and sisters, too.  They yelled, “Go away! We will not play with you! You are ugly. And you walk weird, too!” \n\nWhen Mama Duck was close by, she would not let them talk in this way.  “Be nice!” she would scold. But she was not always close by.\n\nOne day, one of the yellow ducklings said to the Ugly Duckling, “You know what?  You would do us a big favor if you just went away from here!” All of them started to quack, “Get out!  Get out! Get out!”\n“Why won’t they let me stay here?” said the Ugly Duckling to himself.  He hung his head down low. “Ah, they are right. I should go.”\n\nThat night, the Ugly Duckling flew over the farmyard fence.  He flew till he landed on the other side of the lake.  There he met two grown-up ducks.\n \n \n\n“Can I please stay here for awhile?” said the Ugly Duckling.  “I have nowhere else to be.”\n\n“What do we care?” said one of the ducks.  “Just don’t get in our way.”\n\n“Woof! Woof!”  Suddenly a big hungry dog came tearing by, chasing the two ducks.  They quickly flew up in the air, and their feathers fell down on the ground.  The poor Ugly Duckling froze in fear. The dog sniffed and sniffed at the Ugly Duckling, then turned away.  “I am too ugly even for the big hungry dog to want,” said the Ugly Duckling with his head hung low.\n\nThe sky turned dark.  Crack!  A bolt of lightning.  Then came a big storm, with heavy rains pouring down from the sky.  In just moments, the Ugly Duckling was soaked through and through. Then a cold wind started to blow.\n\n“Brrr!” he said with both wings held close to his chest.  “If only there was a place I could get dry.”\n\nAll at once, a tiny light blinked far off in the woods.  “Could it be someone’s hut?”\n\nHe flew to the door.  “Quack?” said the Ugly Duckling.  The door of the hut creaked open.\n \n\n“What is all this noise?” said an old woman, looking right and left.  Her eyes were not that good. Then she looked down. “Ah, look at that, it’s a duck!”  She picked up the Ugly Duckling and dropped him inside her hut. “You can stay here, but only if you lay eggs,” she said.\n\nA tomcat and hen crept up to the Ugly Duckling.  “Who do you think you are, coming in here and taking up room by the fire!” said the tomcat.  \n\n“Squawk!” said the hen.  “I do not need anyone else in this hut laying eggs.”\n“Do not worry about that,” said the Ugly Duckling.  “I am a boy duck.”\n\n“Then why are you still here?” said the tomcat.  “Did you not hear what the old woman said?”\n\n“Get out of here, pretender!” clucked the hen.  \n\n“Get out!  Get out!“ hissed the tomcat.\nThe door was still a bit open, so our poor Ugly Duckling slipped out the door, and back into the storm.\n\n“No one ever wants me,” said the Ugly Duckling with a tear in his eye.  \n\nThe storm ended.  Soon he found a new lake.  Looking into the water, the Ugly Duckling saw the reflection of a flock of large white birds flying.  He looked overhead and could not believe what he saw. There, above him, were the most beautiful birds he had ever seen!  Their long white bodies and slender necks seemed to just glide through the sky. He watched until the very last bird had winged its way out of view.  \n\nHe stayed at that lake all by himself, and time passed.  The leaves of the trees turned deep red and gold, and then the leaves fell to the ground.  Winter came, setting a blanket of white snow all over. The cold wind and the dark clouds made the Ugly Duckling feel even more sad.\n\nHe had to go into the cold, cold lake to fish, but it was getting harder to swim.  The lake was turning to ice. One day, it was all he could do was to paddle the water to keep it from freezing around him, and trapping him in the lake.\n“I am so tired!” he said, paddling with all his might.  The ice got thicker and drew closer to him.\n\nIn a moment, two giant hands swept him up.  “You poor thing!” said a farmer. He held the Ugly Duckling close to his thick wool jacket and took the bird to his home.  \nNever was a warm fireplace more welcome!  For the rest of the winter, the farmer cared for the Ugly Duckling.  Then spring came. Tips of green covered the trees. Short, bright flowers popped up from the ground.  \n\n“It is time for you to go to the lake to swim again, as you were born to do,” said the farmer.  He took the duckling back to the lake where he had found him, and set him with care on the water.\n\n“Gosh, I feel strong,” said the young bird, flapping his wings.  “Why, I never felt as strong as I do right now!”\n\nHe heard quiet splashing sounds behind him, and turned around.  A flock of those same beautiful birds he had seen in the sky before landed behind him on the water.\n\n“Do not worry!” he said to them, holding out one wing.  “I will go now. I will not make trouble for you.” A big fat tear rolled down his cheek.  He turned to go away. When he opened his eyes, he saw a reflection in the water of one of those beautiful white birds.  Why was it so close to him? He jumped back. And the reflection jumped back, too. \n\n“What is this?” he said.  He stretched his neck, and the reflection of the beautiful bird stretched its neck, too.\n“Why are you going so soon?” said one of the beautiful birds.  \n\n“Stay here, with us!” said another.  “We’ll be great friends.”\n\nThen, the bird who used to be the Ugly Duckling knew what had happened!  He was no longer an ugly gray bird that wobbled when it walked. \n\nAt one moment, all the swans flapped their wings and took off into the sky. “Come with us,” one called back. “Take the lead!” So he flapped his wings fast and took his place in front of the whole flock.  All his new friends flapped their wings behind him.\n\n“Say!” he said, gliding and dipping through the sky as he sped on.  “Who’s an ugly duckling now? Surely, Not I!”",

    "content": "Long ago in England, a wise and just king ruled the land.  His name was King Uther. Times were good and the people lived well.  King Uther wanted a magician at court. And so he chose the famous Merlin the Magician.  Merlin could see into the future. And he knew those good days were not going to last.\n\nKing Uther and the Queen Guinevere had a child, a baby son.  \n \n\nAt a castle party for the royal birth, Merlin the Magician took the King aside.  He said, “Sire, there is something you must know. Soon a great darkness will fall over this land.  Your child is in great danger. Let me take the baby far away. I will be sure he stays safe.”\n\n“Merlin!” said the King in surprise. “You are a great magician.  And you are my friend. But there is no way we would let anyone take our child away!”\nSadly, soon after the child’s birth the Queen died.  Not long after, King Uther was killed in battle. That very night, Merlin swept into the castle and took the child.  \n \n\nThe next morning, the royal nurse went into the nursery. Alas, an empty crib! In fear, the nurse, the nobles and servants looked everywhere.  But the baby was gone!\n\nFor years, there was no king to sit on the throne.  No king to set the laws. Men of high rank fought each other to be king.  Darkness fell over the land. Robbers and bands of wild men ruled the streets of London.  Evil men broke into houses and took what they wanted. Travelers on the roads were jumped and robbed.  The people of England lived in fear.\n\nYet far away, there was a quiet place.  A good knight, Sir Ector, lived in peace with his two sons.  His first son was named Kay. His younger son Arthur had been adopted as a baby.  Years before, a stranger had come to Sir Ector with a baby. He asked if Sir Ector would raise the child.  The old knight took the baby in his arms, glad for a second child. He named the baby Arthur, and raised the child as his own.\n \n\nThe Sword in the Stone King Arthur Legend of the Sword Story\n \n\nWhen Arthur was ten years old, the same stranger returned to Sir Ector’s home.  He could read and write, and so Sir Ector hired him to teach his two sons. Kay could not sit still for lessons and he stopped coming.  But Arthur listened with wide eyes. He learned everything. I bet you have guessed by now who that stranger was – none other than Merlin the Magician!  \nAt the end of each day when Arthur finished his chores, that was time for the lessons.  Merlin would sit with Arthur for hours and teach him about the world. Arthur was a thin lad, not strong like his big brother Kay.  Merlin said not to worry about that. He said what mattered most was to have a heart that was big and strong. Merlin saw how the birds, foxes and deer followed Arthur.  He could see that the boy had a very big and strong heart.\n \n\nBy the time Arthur was 16, his brother Kay had become a knight.  He was now called Sir Kay. Arthur loved nothing more than to serve his brother as a squire.  He kept great care of his brother’s tunic and helmet, his spears and lances.\n\nOne day at lesson time, Merlin looked away.  He stood up.\n“What is it?” said Arthur.\n\n“The people need hope,” said Merlin.  “Arthur, there is something I must do.  I must go now.”\n\nThat night, when the nighttime was at its most dark, Merlin the Magician came to London’s market square.  He stood in the middle of the square. He held both his arms high. And pointed his wand to the stars.\n \n\nThe next morning at dawn, people started to arrive at the market.  There in front of them was something most odd. A block of white marble stood in the middle of the town square.  Resting on the block was a giant stone the size of a very large rock. At the very top of the stone there was a golden sword handle and a few inches of the blade, shining in the sun.  Yet – this was most odd – the rest of the blade was buried deep into the stone. None of this was there the day before!\n\nWhat’s more, these words could be seen on the top of the blade:\n\n \n\n“Whoever pulls out this sword from this stone is the true king of England!”\n \n\nAs soon as the crowd knew about the message, men jumped up to that white marble block. One after another, they gave the sword a yank. Each tried and tried, but the sword stuck fast. It would not move.\n\nOne said in gloom, “There is no man alive who could pull out that sword!”\n\n“We’ll see about that!” said a voice in the crowd.  The Duke of Cornwall, dressed in silks and ribbons, stepped up to the white marble block.  “Hear ye, hear ye!” he said. “I call for a tournament to be held, one month from today. Knights from anywhere and everywhere in England are invited to come.  There will be contests and prizes. And a grand feast for all!” The Duke said to his wife, the Duchess, “If I know men, this tournament will draw the strongest, finest knights in all of England!”  \n\nSaid the Duchess, “Good idea, my dear.  All we need is one knight who is so strong he can pull that sword from the stone.  Then we will have a king again, at last!”\n\nThe people danced and cheered.  At last there was something to feel happy about! News of the tournament traveled fast.  From castle to village, to every far corner of the land. At last, word got to the far-away home of Sir Ector.  Sir Kay heard the news when he was polishing his helmet.\n\n“Arthur!” he called out.  Arthur was once again by the woods, feeding birds from his hand.  He set down a pile of seeds for the birds, and a pile for the squirrels.  Then he ran fast to see his brother.\n“There you are!” said Kay.  “There will be a tournament in London.  We must set out at once!”\n\nWhat great news! Arthur had never been more than a few miles from home.  He would be the best squire ever for his brother! Arthur ran back to the house.  In the courtyard his father was getting the horses ready.\n\nSir Ector and his two sons rode through London on their way to the tournament.  Riding through the market square, something shiny glinted in the sun. “That sword looks like it goes right into that stone,” said Arthur.  “But how can that be? That’s impossible.” But why were guards standing all around it?\n\nThe father and his two sons reached the tournament. Sir Kay ran off to get in line to register.  Sir Ector greeted many old friends – dukes, earls, barons, counts and countesses. Arthur sat in their tent, polishing his brother’s helmet till it shone bright.\n\nA bugle sounded.  The tournament was about to begin! “Get my sword, demanded Kay”  \n\n“Right away,” said Arthur.  But where was it? Arthur looked around in panic.  Kay’s spear, battle-axe, and dagger were right where they should be.  But no sword. “Kay…” he said, “how about a battle-axe?”\n\n“Where is my sword?!”  \n\n“I'll have it in a moment!” said Arthur.  \n\n“Be quick about it!” said Kay.\n\nArthur ran back into the tent.  Maybe he had left Kay’s sword there?  He searched through the bag of armor and weapons.  How could he let such a thing happen? Then he had an idea.\n\nVery fast, Arthur rode back to the market square.  The guards were not there anymore – they must have all gone to the tournament.  \n\nArthur stepped up on the marble block.  “Let’s see if that sword can get unstuck.”  He took hold of the handle of the sword. He moved the sword a bit.  “Hey!” he said. “It’s looser than I thought.”\n\nWith one big tug, the sword slid out.  \n\n \n\nThe Sword in the Stone King Arthur Legend of the Sword Story\n \n\nArthur was thrown back, but the sword was safe in his hands.  “I will be sure to bring it right back.” He raced to the where his brother was waiting.\n\n“Here it is,” he said, handing the sword to his brother.\n\nKay took one look.  “Oh!” he said in surprise.\n\n“What is it?” said Arthur.  But his brother was gone. Soon after, he heard his brother’s voice outside the tent.  “Father, I have something to show you.” Kay and his father stepped inside the tent. \n\n“Look!” said Kay.  He pointed to the sword.\n\nSir Ector stared.  His face turned white.  “Kay,” said the father, facing his older son, “where did you get this sword?”\n\n“It is mine!” said Kay, holding it close to him.  “I have it now.”\n\n“Kay!” said the Father again in a stern voice.  “I will ask you one more time. Where did you get this sword?”\n\nThe young knight’s head dropped down.\n\n“From Arthur,” he said.  “He lost my sword! Somehow he got this one.”\n\n“Arthur?” The father turned to his younger son.  “How is it that you came by this sword?”\n\n“I’m sorry!” said Arthur.  “Father, I will put it back right away.  I only meant to borrow it when I pulled it from the stone.” \n\n“You must take us to where you found this sword.  At once!” The three of them rushed over to the market square.\n\nArthur climbed up onto the marble block.  “It came from here,” he said. He lifted the sword over his head.  \n\nThen he dropped the blade back into the stone. “Now it’s back.”\n\n“Hey,” said Sir Kay.  “I still need a sword!”  He jumped up onto the marble block.  Grabbing the hilt of the sword, he pulled and pulled.  But it did not move.\n\nKay shouted to Arthur, “What did you do to it?”\n\n“Nothing!” said the lad.\n\n“You must have done something!” yelled Sir Kay.\n\n“Hush! Both of you!” said the father.  “It is better if no one sees or hears us.”\n\nBut it was too late.  A crowd had already started to form.\n\n“Hey! Did you pull that sword out of the stone?” called one.\n\n \n\n“Yes,” said Arthur. “I did.”  \n\n \n\n“Do it again!” called another from the crowd.  \n\n“Yes, let’s see it!”\n\nArthur put his hands around the golden handle.  With one tug, the blade slid out.\n\n“Who are you?” called another voice. “What’s your name?”\n\n“Arthur,” said the lad.\n\n“Wait a minute, put that sword back!” A tall knight pushed forward from the crowd.  “Anyone can pull it out, once it’s been pulled!”\n\n“Go ahead.  Put it back, son,” said a voice.  It was the Duke of Cornwall, the one who had called for the tournament.\n\n“All right,” said Arthur. He slipped the blade back into the stone, with ease.\n\n“Let me at that now!” said the tall knight.  He jumped up and grabbed the handle of the sword.  But pull and tug as he might, the sword would not move.  Not even a bit.\n\nAnother knight tried.  Then another. But no one could move the sword. Some waited, thinking the longer they pulled the sword, the looser it would get.  But when each man took their turn, the sword did not move for them.\n\n“Let the lad try now,” said the Duke of Cornwall.  “Arthur, go ahead.”\n\n \n\nArthur stepped up to the stone again.  In one motion he freed the sword. This time, he held it high above his head.  The blade flashed in the sun. Amazed, the crowd did not know what to think.\n\n \n\nOne called out at last.  “He must be our new king!”\n\n“We have a king!” called another. “At last!”\n\n“Stop!” shouted the tall knight.  “Do you really think this skinny boy should rule over all of us?”\n\n“Yes!” said a voice.  All eyes turned around.  It was Merlin the Magician.\n\n“I know this boy. I know his heart.  There is no one in England who has a heart that is bigger and stronger than his.  The sword has told us this young man is to be the next king of England. And there is something else!”\n\n“The lad,” said Merlin, pointing to Arthur, “is the true child of King Uther.  He is the missing baby!”\n\nCheers began to ring out.  “Hail, King Arthur!” called someone from the crowd.  \n\nSir Ector fell to his knees.  Then Sir Kay. One person after another fell to their knees, too.  All cheered. At last, a king had been chosen. A fresh young king, and a new day for England!",

    "content": "In the spring of 1607, three ships landed on the shore of what is now America.  About 100 men – no women were asked to come – stepped onto the sand to start a new life. \n\n \n\nPocahontas\n \n\nThe men built 20 cabins and a fort to go around them all.  They called their new town Jamestown.   But they were not the only ones living on that land.\n\nUp and down the coast and for miles into the woods lived tribes of Native Americans.  Today, the area is called Virginia.  \n\nBack then, it was called the Powhatan Confederacy.  Over 30 tribes in the Powhatan Confederacy were ruled by one chief.  His name was Powhatan. \n\nChief Powhatan’s scouts told him that new men had landed on the shore.  They told him the men had built a fort.  They also told him the new men spoke in words no one had heard before.  They wore clothes no one had seen before.  \n\nPowhatan knew all that.  What he did not know – and what he wanted to know most of all - was, where did they come from?  Why were they here? And what would it be like to be their Chief?\n\nHis scouts told him some other news, too, that was most odd.  No crops had been planted around the fort.\n\nNo canoes were anywhere near the fort, and the men did not even stand by the river to fish.  The men did not go into the woods to hunt, either. Said Powhatan, “These men do not know how to plant, ride a canoe, fish or hunt.  It will be easier than I thought to be their Chief.\n\nWe will bring food to them – corn, beans and squash. Without us, they will starve.  And I, Powhatan, who rules 30 tribes, will rule over them, too!”\n“Father let me come with you!” said Powhatan’s daughter Pocahontas.  No one had seen her slip into the longhouse. “I want to see the fort, too.” “Surely not!” said her father.  “You have work to do here.  When you are done, you may play with your sisters.”\n\n “I play with them every day!” said Pocahontas.  “Father, please! I’ll be good!”   Powhatan smiled. \n\n“Ah, my princess,” he said.  “How can I say no to that face?” At last, an adventure for Pocahontas!  She felt sure that if she had to sew beads onto one more moccasin, or fill one more basket with berries, she would burst! So Chief Powhatan, with scouts carrying baskets of corn, beans and squash, and with Pocahontas beside them, all went over to the fort. \n\nWhen they got there, they set down the baskets.  And stepped back. In a minute, men burst out of the fort with big smiles on their faces.  You can be sure there was much joy! Pocahontas saw something else that made her smile, too.  Four boys a bit older than she came out with the other men.  She waved to the boys.  They waved back!  When the grown-ups were trying to talk to each other with their arms and hands, she said to them, “Want to play?”  \n\n \n\nPocahontas\n \n\nThey did not understand her words.  But soon they were showing her how to play tag and stickball.  And she was showing them how to do cartwheels. After a while, Powhatan called, “Pocahontas! It’s time to go.” Every four or five days after that, Pocahontas came back with the others to the fort. Each time, Powhatan’s scouts carried corn, squash, and beans.  Sometimes for a special treat, maple sugar, too.  Pocahontas learned the names of her new friends – James, Nathaniel, Richard and Samuel. And they learned hers.  She also learned the name of their leader, John Smith.\n\nAs the days got shorter, the rain stopped coming. The corn in the fields dried up.  The squash and the beans on the vine dried up.  Berries on the bushes dried up. “We cannot take food to the fort anymore,” said Powhatan.  “We need to save all we have so our people will make it through the winter.  We must go to the fort and tell them.” \n\nWhen the men in the fort heard the news, they got angry.  They marched into their cabins.  They came out with guns, and shot the guns into the sky. Powhatan got angry, too.  He said, “I warn you, white men!  Do not go anywhere near our village!  If you do, you will be sorry!”  The men of Jamestown could not understand what Powhatan was saying.  But they could tell from his face that they were not friends anymore. \n\nSoon after that, John Smith was going through the woods looking for food.  He was close to the village of Powhatan.  Too close.  Powhatan’s brother and some of the tribe saw him pass.  In a flash, they jumped out at him.  They held John Smith down and took him back to Powhatan’s village. “Now it will be done, once and for all,” said Powhatan.  “I will be Chief to all the people in the fort.”\n\nThat winter, John Smith could not leave the village.  Still, Powhatan made him feel at home.  Pocahontas, who knew him from before, spent time with him.  Day after day, they would teach each other the words that each other’s people spoke. \n\nAs the snow melted, the people of Powhatan’s village started to get ready for a festival.  Powhatan called John Smith into his longhouse.  “The festival will soon be here,” he said. “What festival?” said John Smith.  Now he could better understand what Powhatan was saying. “The festival to mark the time when your people join my people.  When I become your Chief.” “That will never happen!” shouted John Smith. Powhatan did not know the words the young man was saying.  But the Chief could tell that John Smith was angry.  “Your people have no choice!” said Powhatan. “If you will not join my tribe, you must die!” \n\nNo one saw Pocahontas slip into the longhouse.  Powhatan said: “Put his head on the rock!” Two strong braves grabbed John Smith and pushed his head down on a rock.  Powhatan lifted a large rock above him, ready to strike. “No!” the girl cried out.  All of a sudden, Pocahontas rushed up and bent over John Smith, placing her own head over his.  \n\nPowhatan held the rock high in the air. “Pocahontas!” he cried out.  “Move away!” “I will not move!” she said, turning her head to the side.  “Let him be.  Let all of them be!” Powhatan held up the rock.  Then, he lowered his arms.  “My daughter,” he said in a soft voice. “You are right.  No good can come from hurting these people.”\n\nAfter that, Powhatan set John Smith free.  Powhatan’s tribes brought food again to the men in the fort, this time smoked meat and fish. ",

    "content": "Once upon a time, a princess named Snow White lived in a castle with her father, the King, and her stepmother, the Queen. Her father had always said to his daughter that she must be fair to everyone at court. Said he: “People come here to the castle when they have a problem. They need the ruler to make a fair decision. Nothing is more important than to be fair.”\nThe Queen, Snow White’s stepmother, knew how much this meant to her husband. At the first chance, she rushed to her magic mirror.  “Mirror, mirror, on the wall,” said the Queen.  “Who is the fairest of them all?”\n\n“Snow White is the fairest of them all!” said the Magic Mirror.\n “What?!” yelled the Queen.  “No one is more fair than I!  The Queen must have the best of everything - everyone knows that.  What could be more fair?”\n“Snow White is the fairest of them all!” repeated the Magic Mirror.\n\n “What do you know – you’re a mirror!” roared the Queen.  And she stormed off. \n\nStill, the Queen was bothered.  So bothered was she that the Queen decided to be rid of the girl, once and for all. \n\n“I cannot wait another day!” she declared.  The Queen called for her servant, a huntsman.  “Find a reason to take Snow White deep into the woods,” she said, pointing her long finger at the servant. “Then kill her.”\n\nThe huntsman was shocked!  But she was the Queen and what could he do?  The next day he took Snow White into the woods.  As he drew his knife to slay her, Snow White turned around.\n\n \n\n“Look,” she said, taking something out of her pocket.  “You have always been good to me.”  She held in front of him six perfect arrowheads that she had carefully shaped. “Do you like them?” she said.  “They are for you.”\n\n“Snow White,” said the huntsman.  “I cannot do this!”\n“Of course you can take these,” said Snow White.\n\n\"That's not what I meant,\" said the servant.  He dropped to his knees.  “How can I say this to you?  The Queen, your step-mother, ordered me to kill you,” he said.  “But I cannot!”\n\n“She did what?” Snow White called out with alarm.\n\n“You must run away!” said the huntsman.  “Far into the woods.  Now!  And never come back to the castle!”\nSnow White turned and ran into the woods as fast as she could.  Deeper and deeper she ran.  It was getting dark, and the wolves were starting to howl.  She tripped and her skirt was torn.  Tall tree branches seemed to reach down to the very ground to grab her.  She was scratched, bleeding and scared.  Yet she ran on and on.\n\nThen all of a sudden, far away, there was a light.  Who was living so deep in the woods?  She stepped up closer.  It was a cottage!  Yet no sound came from the cottage, only light from the windows.\n\n \n\n“Hello?” she said, knocking softly on the door.  “Hello?” No answer.  The door was a little bit open.  She opened it some more and stepped in.  “Hello, is anyone home?” \n\nShe looked around.  What a mess!  She had never seen a messier living room.\n\n“This cottage may be the biggest mess I ever saw,” she thought.  “But it's a roof over my head for tonight. Maybe if I clean up around here, I can earn my sleep.”\n\nAs she cleaned, she thought of someone she already missed.  Before her father had re-married, she and a Prince who lived in the next kingdom were getting to know each other.  They would take long walks in the royal garden and tell each other stories, and laugh. \n\nAfter the Queen had moved into the castle, her stepmother had made a new rule – no more visitors.  Now the Prince had to slip over the palace gate in secret. He would call out to her from under her window and they could talk a bit that way. It wasn’t as good as the long walks but it was the best they could manage.  \n\nNow that she had to run away from home, would she ever see him again?\n\nAfter Snow White cleaned up the living room, she went upstairs.  On the second floor, there were seven little beds lined up in a row, as if for children.  Tired from cleaning, Snow White yawned and lay across all seven of the beds.  Soon she fell fast asleep.\n\nIn the meantime, the Seven Dwarfs were heading home from a long day of working in the jewel mines.  When they opened the door, you can imagine their surprise when they saw their cottage all cleaned up!\n\n“What kind of magic is this?” said one of the Dwarfs, whose name was Doc.\n\n“I wouldn’t mind more magic like this!” said another of the Dwarfs with a smile.  His name was Dopey.\n\n“We'd better check upstairs,” said another Dwarf, whose name was Grumpy.  “Something is fishy around here, that’s for sure.”\nThere – lying across all their beds, was a young lady, fast asleep. \n\n“Who are you?” said all the Dwarfs at once.  \n\nSnow White bolted awake.  The Seven Dwarfs could tell she was as surprised as they were.  Soon they all relaxed and shared their stories. \n\nSnow White learned their names – Bashful, Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, and Sneezy. She told them all about her step-mother.  That her stepmother had tried to get the huntsman to kill her, that the huntsman had set her free in the woods, and that she could never go back home again.\n\n“Stay here, with us,” said Bashful. \n“That’s sweet,” said Snow White.  “But if I were to stay here at your home, I would have to do something for all of you.”\n\n“You already cleaned up our place,” said Sneezy. \n“Keeping the house clean will be easy,” said Snow White, “as long as we all pitch in.  I will let everyone know what part they can do, and I will do my share too, of course.”\n\n“That’s fair,” said Happy.\n\n“But there must be something else I can do for you,” said Snow White.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs shrugged.\n\n“Do you know how to read?” said Doc.  \"We have these books filled with wonderful tales and would love to be able to read them.\" And so it was agreed that Snow White would teach them how to read.   \n\nTo celebrate their new friendship, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs sang and danced the night away. \nThe next morning before they left for work, the Seven Dwarfs warned Snow White she must not open the door to anyone.  After all, who knows what evil her stepmother might do?  The princess nodded in agreement, and the Dwarfs left the house.  The princess prepared her first reading lesson. She also prepared a good hot meal for the Seven Dwarfs when they returned home that night.  And so the days passed.\n\nBack at the castle, the Queen marched up to her mirror.  “Mirror, mirror on the wall,\" she demanded.  \"Who is the fairest of them all?”\n\n“Snow White is the fairest of them all!” said the Magic Mirror. \n\n“That’s impossible!” screamed the Queen.  “The girl is no longer alive!”\n\n“Snow White lives!” said the Magic Mirror.  And an image was shown on the mirror of Snow White living in the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs.\n\nThe Queen turned red with rage.  She screamed, “Who does she think she is?!  Snow White will not get away with this!”\n\nAt the cottage of the Dwarfs the next afternoon, when the Seven Dwarfs were away at work, there was a knock on the door.\n\n“Who is it?” said Snow White.  She remembered the warning of the Seven Dwarfs not to open the door to anyone.\n\n“It’s only a poor old woman,” came a squeaky voice, “selling apples.” Yet it was the evil Queen, disguised as an old woman.  “It’s raining out here, my dear,” said her voice through the door.  “Please let me in.”\n\n“Poor thing,\" thought Snow White, \"having to go door to door selling apples in the rain.\"  And so she opened the door.\n“Take a look at this big red apple,” said the old woman, who as you know by now was really the Queen in disguise. She held the red apple close to Snow White’s face.  “Lovely, my dear, isn’t it?” \n\n“I would like very much to buy your apple,” said Snow White. “But I have no money.”\n\n“That fine comb in your hair will make a good trade,” said the old woman.\n\n“Well, all right then!” said Snow White.  She took the comb out of her hair and gave it to the old woman, who then gave her the apple.  Snow White took a big bite.  Alas, the fruit was poisoned!  At once, Snow White fell to the ground in a deep sleep. \n“YES!” shouted the Queen, pumping the air with her fists. \n\nJust then the door flew open.  In marched the Seven Dwarfs, home from the day's work.  Shocked indeed they were to find Snow White lying on the floor and what must be her stepmother beside her, laughing!\n\nThey chased that evil Queen out the door, and into the storm.  Up to the very top of a mountain they chased her.  All of a sudden, lightning hit the mountain!  The Queen fell, and she was never seen again.\n\nBut there was nothing to help poor Snow White.  She stayed absolutely still in her deep sleep.  The Seven Dwarfs gently lifted her into a glass coffin.  Day and night they kept watch over her.\n\nOne day, the Prince happened to pass through.  Ever since he had learned that Snow White was missing at the castle, he was searching for her, far and wide.  Now he had finally found her, but in such a state! The Prince pulled open the glass coffin.  Her face seemed so fresh, even in that deep sleep.  \n\nHe gently took one of Snow White's hands in his own and kissed it.  At once, Snow White’s eyes opened!  With Love's First Kiss, the evil Queen's spell was forever gone. Now nothing stood in the way for Snow White and the Prince to be together forever.  They returned to the Prince's kingdom and lived happily ever after.",

    "content": "Long ago in France there lived a King and Queen.  More than anything, they longed for a child.  At last, to their great happiness, the Queen gave birth to a little girl.  All the bells in the land were rung with joy.  \n\nThe King and Queen invited all the fairies in the kingdom to the Naming Party for the baby.  And what a party it was!  Plates and silverware of pure gold were set with care before each guest. But one fairy, Maleficent, who had left 50 years before and had not been seen in all that time, showed up at the door.  Quickly the King and Queen found a place setting for the new guest.  But alas, the plate and the silverware were not of pure gold.  This made the old fairy very angry.\n\nSoon it was time for each Fairy to give her blessing to the baby.  When it came to Maleficent’s turn, she stood up and pointed her long finger at the sleeping baby girl in the cradle.\n“I declare, before all of you,” Maleficent called out, “that this child, on her 16th birthday, shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel, and die!”\n \n\nWith a whoosh of smoke, the evil fairy vanished.  Everyone cried out with alarm, as you can imagine.  But one fairy had not yet given her blessing.  The King and Queen asked this fairy, whose name was Merryweather, to reverse the curse.  Merryweather shook her head sadly –  that was not possible.  But she could soften the curse. \n“On her 16th birthday,” she said, “when the princess pricks her finger on the spinning wheel, instead of dying she will fall asleep for 100 years.”\n“One hundred years!” said the Queen.  “After our daughter turns 16, we will not know her anymore!”\n\nThe King ordered every spinning wheel in the kingdom to be brought to the palace and burned.  To be extra sure the princess would not be anywhere near a spinning wheel, he also ordered the fairy Merryweather, along with two other fairies, Flora and Fauna, to take the baby far away. \n \n\nThe fairies would raise the child in a cottage, deep in the woods.  There, they would keep her safe until after her 16th birthday.  After that day it would be safe to bring back the princess, who had been named Aurora, to the castle.\nAurora grew up knowing no others than the three fairies, whom she knew as her aunts.  The animals of the forest were her friends. \n\nThe birds and the deer, the chipmunks and the rabbits, followed her around as she fed them treats and cooed to them. \n \n\nFrom the time she was little, Aurora was told she must stay inside the hills that surrounded them.  She did not mind that in the least.  The woods were wide and deep inside the hills, and there was plenty of room for her to play.\n\nOne day, Aurora came home to the cottage to find her three aunts preparing for a party.  “What’s going on?” she said.\n\n“Tonight we will celebrate your 16th birthday!” said Flora. \n“It is?” said Aurora.  “That means tomorrow I go back to the castle!”\n\n“Yes!” said Merryweather.  “We have kept you safe from that spinning wheel for 16 years. Soon it will be time for you to take up your royal life as a princess.”\n “And the first thing for you will be to get married,” said Fauna. \n\n“Married, already?” said Aurora.  “Do you know who I’m supposed to marry?”\n\n“We do,” said Fauna with a wave of her hand, “but there’s no need to worry about that.  Even if he’s a bit strange, some might say a bit horrid,  you won’t have to spend much time with him,after all.”\n\n“And he does come from a fine family,” Flora added with a quick smile.\n\n“Wait a minute!” said Aurora, pulling back.  “Why do you say he’s a bit horrid?”\n\n“It’s best not focus on such things, dear,” said Merryweather. \n\n“Just do everything your husband tells you to do,” said Flora, “and you will be fine.”\n“This is not turning out like I thought!” cried Aurora.  “How long do I have to stay married?”\n\n \n\n“For the rest of your life, of course,” said Fauna.\n\n \n\n“No, no, this is all wrong!” cried Aurora.  She turned away, then said in a firm voice,  “I would rather prick my finger on a spinning wheel and fall asleep for 100 years than have to marry someone I don't want to marry! Maybe by the time I wake up, people won’t have to get married if they don’t want to!”  And she ran out the door.\n\n“Dear me,” said Merryweather to the other two fairies.  “I don’t believe that went over very well.”\nAurora ran deep into the woods where her animal friends lived. \n\nA deer hopped beside her, along with the rabbits and chipmunks.  “We have to get out of here,” she said to all of them. Then pointing to a mountain pass, she said, “We will go right through the hills.”\n\nSoon Aurora came to a road.  In the distance was a carriage, coming closer to her.  As the rider approached, her animal friends scattered.\n\n“Hail!” said the stranger.  “I’m afraid my carriage scared away your pets.  May I give you a lift?”\nAurora had never seen a man before.  But she couldn’t think about that – unless she could find a spinning wheel, the very next day her aunts would take her back to the palace. \n\n“Actually,” said Aurora to the stranger, “there is something I need a great deal.”\n\n“What’s that?” said the stranger, hopping out of the carriage.  Very nicely dressed was he, and well mannered, too.\n \n\n“A spinning wheel,” said Aurora.\n\n“A spinning wheel!” said the stranger.  “But there are none left in the land – everyone knows that.”  \n“Well, you see,” said Aurora, rubbing her hands together, “I have this friend.  She needs a spinning wheel in the worst way.”  Aurora looked directly at the stranger.  “It’s a matter of life or death.”\n\nThe stranger looked at Aurora’s eyes.  At last, he said, “I may know of one,” he said.  “But this needs to stay between you and me.”  The stranger stepped closer. \n“Not far from here lives an old woman who spun yarn all her life.  When the orders came to burn all the spinning wheels, she could not bear to let go of her beloved spinning wheel since it had been in her family for many years.  She came to me,” he said, pointing down the road, “as I’m a prince from the next kingdom. She begged me to let her store it away safely. So I put it in the attic room of my castle tower, where no one ever goes, until the 16 years had passed.”\n\n \n\n“Would you take me to your castle tower?” said Aurora.\n\n \n\n“I shouldn’t,” said the prince.  Then after a moment, he said, “But I will.”\n\nShe stepped onto his carriage.  Soon they were at the tower, and they both stepped out.  The prince said, “This is not for your friend, is it?”\n\n“Thank you for taking me here,” said Aurora.  “I will always remember your kindness.  Now if you please, I must do what I must do.”\n\nAurora turned and went up the tower stairs to the very last stair.  The door in front of her creaked open.  Inside, all was dark and musty.  She could barely take a step for all the spider webs. \n \n\nBut she pushed them aside and stepped forward. There, in a far corner, was the spinning wheel.  From a small window, she could tell the sun was already setting.  “I hope this works,” she said, “before it’s too late.”\n\nAurora held out her finger to the tip of the spindle.  She pricked her finger on that spindle.  One tiny droplet of blood dripped from her finger. At once, Aurora felt dizzy.  She fell onto an old dusty velvet blanket that lay on the attic floor, and fell into a deep sleep.  Moments later, all the others in the castle, servants and royals alike, fell asleep too, and so did the prince, who was still waiting for her outside the tower.  Within hours, thorns and vines had sprung up and wrapped around the castle, so thickly that no human or beast could pass through.\n\n \n\nFor 100 years, Aurora and the others slept. \n\n \n\nAfter 100 years had passed, Aurora blinked her eyes awake.  Then all the others in the castle also awoke.  Everyone started to do what they had been doing when they had fallen asleep 100 years before. The thorns and vines around the castle melted away.\n\nAurora stepped down the tower stairs to find the prince.\n\nTogether, they stepped into the prince’s carriage.  Down the road to the market square, they discovered a whole new world.  Bicycles and streetcars, cameras and streetlights – such marvels to behold! \n\nPerhaps best of all, they learned that in this strange new time, it was quite all right for young women and men to get to know each other, if that’s what they wanted to do, and even perhaps to fall in love. \n \n\nAs Aurora and the Prince took each other’s hand to explore this wonderful new world together, that is exactly what they wanted to do.",

    "content": "Once upon a time there was a Princess.  Many a suitor came to the palace to win her hand in marriage, but it seemed to the Princess that each one of them looked at her without really seeing her at all.  \n“They act like there’s nothing more to a princess than her fine crown and royal dresses,” she said to herself with a frown.\n\nOne afternoon after one of these visits, the Princess thought, “Sometimes I wish I were little again.” She found her favorite ball from childhood, the one that sparkled when she threw it up high to the sun.  She took the ball to the palace yard and threw it higher and higher.\n \n\nOne time she threw it extra high and when she ran to catch the ball, she tripped on a tree stump. The ball fell and plopped right down into the royal well!  She raced over to fetch her ball before it dropped too far, but by the time she got there she could no longer see it in the water.\n\n“Oh no!” she moaned, “This is terrible!”  Just then a small green frog poked its head above the water.  \n\n“Maybe I can help you,” said the Frog. \n\n“Yes,” said the Princess. “Please get my ball!”\n\n“No problem,” said the Frog.  “But first there’s something I must ask of you.”\n\n“What do you mean?” said the Princess.\n\n“It’s for you to spend time with me today,” said the Frog.\n\n“I’m not sure I know what that means,” said the Princess.\n\n“Just spend time with me today,” repeated the Frog.\n \n\n“All right then, fine!” said the Princess.  “Now please, get my ball!”\n\n \n\n“I’m on it,” said the Frog.  He dived deep into the well. A few moments later, up he came with the ball held high in one hand.\n“Thank you,” said the Princess, taking it from him.  \n\nShe turned to go.\n\n“Wait a minute!” said the Frog.  “You promised to spend time with me today!”\n\n“I already did,” she said with a shrug.  And the Princess walked back to the palace.\nThat night at dinner with her family and the royal advisers, there was a knock on the door. The servant opened the door and saw no one there. The Frog, standing down low, cleared his throat. \n\n“The Princess promised to spend time with me today,” said the Frog in as loud a voice as he could.  “So here I am.”\n\n“Daughter!” said the King from the far end of the table.  “Did you promise to spend time with this Frog, as he claims?”\n\n“Sort of,” said the Princess.  After a pause, she added, “Oh very well, come on in.”\n\n \n\nThe servants quickly set a new place setting for the Frog, and he hopped over to the royal dining table.\n\n \n\nConversation turned to a topic of concern in the kingdom.  None of the royal advisers knew what to do.\n\n“Father, if I may,” said the Princess.  “Perhaps we could–“\n“Stop!” said the King, cutting her off.  “I have enough advisors, believe me.”\n\n“If I may,” said the Frog, and it was the first time he had spoken at the table.   \n\n“There’s more to a princess than her fine crown and royal dresses.”\nThe Princess stared at the Frog. How could this little frog – more than anyone else – understand such a thing?\n\nAfter dinner, the Frog bowed to the Princess.  He said, “You have done what you said you would do.  I suppose it’s time now for me to go.”\n\n“No wait!” said the Princess, “it’s not that late.  How about a walk in the garden?”\n\nThe Frog was delighted.  The two of them walked in the royal garden, the Frog hopping along the stone wall so he and the Princess were at the same level and could talk easily.\n \n \n\n They laughed about many things. Later, when the sun set, they admired the deep rosy reds it cast in the sky.\n\nThe Princess said, “You know, being with you tonight was a lot more fun than I thought.”\n\n“I had a very good time, too,” said the Frog.\n\n“Who knew?” said the Princess with a laugh. She leaned over and kissed the Frog lightly on his cheek. \n\nAt once, there was a puff of clouds and smoke.  The small green frog had changed into a young prince!  The Princess jumped back in surprise, and who could blame her?  The Prince quickly told her not to worry, that all was well. Years before, an evil witch had put a spell on him that he must stay a frog until he was kissed by a princess.\n\nThe witch had laughed an evil laugh, saying, “Like THAT will ever happen!” But it did!\n\nNow the Prince and Princess could get to know each other better.  Years later, after they were married, they had a beautiful setting made for the ball and placed it on their royal dining table.  And when the sunlight shone in through the palace windows, the ball sparkled for all to see.",

    "content": "There was once a farmer who had three sons. One day when the boys were grown to manhood he said to them:\n\n“My sons, it is high time that you were all married. To-morrow I wish you to go out in search of brides.”\n\n“But where shall we go?” the oldest son asked.\n\n“I have thought of that, too,” the father said. “Do each of you chop down a tree and then take the direction in which the fallen tree points. I’m sure that each of you if you go far enough in that direction will find a suitable bride.”\n\nSo the next day the three sons chopped down trees. The oldest son’s tree fell pointing north.\n\n“That suits me!” he said, for he knew that to the north lay a farm where a very pretty girl lived.\n\nThe tree of the second son when it fell pointed south.\n\n“That suits me!” the second son declared thinking of a girl that he had often danced with who lived on a farm to the south.\n\nThe youngest son’s tree—the youngest son’s name was Veikko—when it fell pointed straight to the forest.\n\n“Ha! Ha!” the older brothers laughed. “Veikko will have to go courting one of the Wolf girls or one of the Foxes!”\n\nThey meant by this that only animals lived in the forest and they thought they were making a good joke at Veikko’s expense. But Veikko said he was perfectly willing to take his chances and go where his tree pointed.\n\nThe older brothers went gaily off and presented their suits to the two farmers whose daughters they admired. Veikko, too, started off with brave front but after he had gone some distance in the forest his courage began to ebb.\n\n“How can I find a bride,” he asked himself, “in a place where there are no human creatures at all!”\n\nJust then he came to a little hut. He pushed open the door and went in. It was empty. To be sure there was a little mouse sitting on the table, daintily combing her whiskers, but a mouse of course doesn’t count.\n\n“There’s nobody here!” Veikko said aloud.\n\nThe little mouse paused in her toilet and turning towards him said reproachfully:\n\n“Why, Veikko, I’m here!”\n\n“But you don’t count. You’re only a mouse!”\n\n“Of course I count!” the little mouse declared. “But tell me, what were you hoping to find?”\n\n“I was hoping to find a sweetheart.”\n\nThe little mouse questioned him further and Veikko told her the whole story of his brothers and the trees.\n\n“The two older ones are finding sweethearts easily enough,” Veikko said, “but I don’t see how I can off here in the forest. And it will shame me to have to go home and confess that I alone have failed.”\n\n“See here, Veikko,” the little mouse said, “why don’t you take me for your sweetheart?”\n\nVeikko laughed heartily.\n\n“But you’re only a mouse! Whoever heard of a man having a mouse for a sweetheart!”\n\nThe mouse shook her little head solemnly.\n\n“Take my word for it, Veikko, you could do much worse than have me for a sweetheart! Even if I am only a mouse I can love you and be true to you.”\n\nShe was a dear dainty little mouse and as she sat looking up at Veikko with her little paws under her chin and her bright little eyes sparkling Veikko liked her more and more.\n\nThen she sang Veikko a pretty little song and the song cheered him so much that he forgot his disappointment at not finding a human sweetheart and as he left her to go home he said:\n\n“Very well, little mouse, I’ll take you for my sweetheart!”\n\nAt that the mouse made little squeaks of delight and she told him that she’d be true to him and wait for him no matter how long he was in returning.\n\nWell, the older brothers when they got home boasted loudly about their sweethearts.\n\n“Mine,” said the oldest, “has the rosiest reddest cheeks you ever saw!”\n\n“And mine,” the second announced, “has long yellow hair!”\n\nVeikko said nothing.\n\n“What’s the matter, Veikko?” the older brothers asked him, laughing. “Has your sweetheart pretty pointed ears or sharp white teeth?”\n\nYou see they were still having their little joke about foxes and wolves.\n\n“You needn’t laugh,” Veikko said. “I’ve found a sweetheart. She’s a gentle dainty little thing gowned in velvet.”\n\n“Gowned in velvet!” echoed the oldest brother with a frown.\n\n“Just like a princess!” the second brother sneered.\n\n“Yes,” Veikko repeated, “gowned in velvet like a princess. And when she sits up and sings to me I’m perfectly happy.”\n\n“Huh!” grunted the older brothers not at all pleased that Veikko should have so grand a sweetheart.\n\n“Well,” said the old farmer after a few days, “now I should like to know what those sweethearts of yours are able to do. Have them each bake me a loaf of bread so that I can see whether they’re good housewives.”\n\n“Mine will be able to bake bread—I’m sure of that!” the oldest brother declared boastfully.\n\n“So will mine!” chorused the second brother.\n\nVeikko was silent.\n\n“What about the Princess?” they said with a laugh. “Do you think the Princess can bake bread?”\n\n“I don’t know,” Veikko answered truthfully. “I’ll have to ask her.”\n\nOf course he had no reason for supposing that the little mouse could bake bread and by the time he reached the hut in the forest he was feeling sad and discouraged.\n\nWhen he pushed open the door he found the little mouse as before seated on the table daintily combing her whiskers. At sight of Veikko she danced about with delight.\n\n“I’m so glad to see you!” she squeaked. “I knew you would come back!”\n\nThen when she noticed that he was silent she asked him what was the matter. Veikko told her:\n\n“My father wants each of our sweethearts to bake him a loaf of bread. If I come home without a loaf my brothers will laugh at me.”\n\n“You won’t have to go home without a loaf!” the little mouse said. “I can bake bread.”\n\nVeikko was much surprised at this.\n\n“I never heard of a mouse that could bake bread!”\n\n“Well, I can!” the little mouse insisted.\n\nWith that she began ringing a small silver bell, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle. Instantly there was the sound of hurrying footsteps, tiny scratchy footsteps, and hundreds of mice came running into the hut.\n\nThe little Princess mouse sitting up very straight and dignified said to them:\n\n“Each of you go fetch me a grain of the finest wheat.”\n\nAll the mice scampered quickly away and soon returned one by one, each carrying a grain of the finest wheat. After that it was no trick at all for the Princess mouse to bake a beautiful loaf of wheaten bread.\n\nThe next day the three brothers presented their father the loaves of their sweethearts’ baking. The oldest one had a loaf of rye bread.\n\n“Very good,” the farmer said. “For hardworking people like us rye bread is good.”\n\nThe loaf the second son had was made of barley.\n\n“Barley bread is also good,” the farmer said.\n\nBut when Veikko presented his loaf of beautiful wheaten bread, his father cried out:\n\n“What! White bread! Ah, Veikko now must have a sweetheart of wealth!”\n\n“Of course!” the older brothers sneered. “Didn’t he tell us she was a Princess? Say, Veikko, when a Princess wants fine white flour, how does she get it?”\n\nVeikko answered simply:\n\n“She rings a little silver bell and when her servants come in she tells them to bring her grains of the finest wheat.”\n\nAt this the older brothers nearly exploded with envy until their father had to reprove them.\n\n“There! There!” he said. “Don’t grudge the boy his good luck! Each girl has baked the loaf she knows how to make and each in her own way will probably make a good wife. But before you bring them home to me I want one further test of their skill in housewifery. Let them each send me a sample of their weaving.”\n\nThe older brothers were delighted at this for they knew that their sweethearts were skilful weavers.\n\n“We’ll see how her ladyship fares this time!” they said, sure in their hearts that Veikko’s sweetheart, whoever she was, would not put them to shame with her weaving.\n\nVeikko, too, had serious doubts of the little mouse’s ability at the loom.\n\n“Whoever heard of a mouse that could weave?” he said to himself as he pushed open the door of the forest hut.\n\n“Oh, there you are at last!” the little mouse squeaked joyfully.\n\nShe reached out her little paws in welcome and then in her excitement she began dancing about on the table.\n\n“Are you really glad to see me, little mouse?” Veikko asked.\n\n“Indeed I am!” the mouse declared. “Am I not your sweetheart? I’ve been waiting for you and waiting, just wishing that you would return! Does your father want something more this time, Veikko?”\n\n“Yes, and it’s something I’m afraid you can’t give me, little mouse.”\n\n“Perhaps I can. Tell me what it is.”\n\n“It’s a sample of your weaving. I don’t believe you can weave. I never heard of a mouse that could weave.”\n\n“Tut! Tut!” said the mouse. “Of course I can weave! It would be a strange thing if Veikko’s sweetheart couldn’t weave!”\n\nShe rang the little silver bell, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, and instantly there was the faint scratch-scratch of a hundred little feet as mice came running in from all directions and sat up on their haunches awaiting their Princess’ orders.\n\n“Go each of you,” she said, “and get me a fiber of flax, the finest there is.”\n\nThe mice went scurrying off and soon they began returning one by one each bringing a fiber of flax. When they had spun the flax and carded it, the little mouse wove a beautiful piece of fine linen. It was so sheer that she was able when she folded it to put it into an empty nutshell.\n\n“Here, Veikko,” she said, “here in this little box is a sample of my weaving. I hope your father will like it.”\n\nVeikko when he got home felt almost embarrassed for he was sure that his sweetheart’s weaving would shame his brothers. So at first he kept the nutshell hidden in his pocket.\n\nThe sweetheart of the oldest brother had sent as a sample of her weaving a square of coarse cotton.\n\n“Not very fine,” the farmer said, “but good enough.”\n\nThe second brother’s sample was a square of cotton and linen mixed.\n\n“A little better,” the farmer said, nodding his head.\n\nThen he turned to Veikko.\n\n“And you, Veikko, has your sweetheart not given you a sample of her weaving?”\n\nVeikko handed his father a nutshell at sight of which his brothers burst out laughing.\n\n“Ha! Ha! Ha!” they laughed. “Veikko’s sweetheart gives him a nut when he asks for a sample of her weaving.”\n\nBut their laughter died as the farmer opened the nutshell and began shaking out a great web of the finest linen.\n\n“Why, Veikko, my boy!” he cried, “however did your sweetheart get threads for so fine a web?”\n\nVeikko answered modestly:\n\n“She rang a little silver bell and ordered her servants to bring her in fibers of finest flax. They did so and after they had spun the flax and carded it, my sweetheart wove the web you see.”\n\n“Wonderful!” gasped the farmer. “I have never known such a weaver! The other girls will be all right for farmers’ wives but Veikko’s sweetheart might be a Princess! Well,” concluded the farmer, “it’s time that you all brought your sweethearts home. I want to see them with my own eyes. Suppose you bring them to-morrow.”\n\n“She’s a good little mouse and I’m very fond of her,” Veikko thought to himself as he went out to the forest, “but my brothers will certainly laugh when they find she is only a mouse! Well, I don’t care if they do laugh! She’s been a good little sweetheart to me and I’m not going to be ashamed of her!”\n\nSo when he got to the hut he told the little mouse at once that his father wanted to see her.\n\nThe little mouse was greatly excited.\n\n“I must go in proper style!” she said.\n\nShe rang the little silver bell and ordered her coach and five. The coach when it came turned out to be an empty nutshell and the five prancing steeds that were drawing it were five black mice. The little mouse seated herself in the coach with a coachman mouse on the box in front of her and a footman mouse on the box behind her.\n\n“Oh, how my brothers will laugh!” thought Veikko.\n\nBut he didn’t laugh. He walked beside the coach and told the little mouse not to be frightened, that he would take good care of her. His father, he told her, was a gentle old man and would be kind to her.\n\nWhen they left the forest they came to a river which was spanned by a foot bridge. Just as Veikko and the nutshell coach had reached the middle of the bridge, a man met them coming from the opposite direction.\n\n“Mercy me!” the man exclaimed as he caught sight of the strange little coach that was rolling along beside Veikko. “What’s that?”\n\nHe stooped down and looked and then with a loud laugh he put out his foot and pushed the coach, the little mouse, her servants, and her five prancing steeds—all off the bridge and into the water below.\n\n“What have you done! What have you done!” Veikko cried. “You’ve drowned my poor little sweetheart!”\n\nThe man thinking Veikko was crazy hurried away.\n\nVeikko with tears in his eyes looked down into the water.\n\n“You poor little mouse!” he said. “How sorry I am that you are drowned! You were a faithful loving sweetheart and now that you are gone I know how much I loved you!”\n\nAs he spoke he saw a beautiful coach of gold drawn by five glossy horses go up the far bank of the river. A coachman in gold lace held the reins and a footman in pointed cap sat up stiffly behind. The most beautiful girl in the world was seated in the coach. Her skin was as red as a berry and as white as snow, her long golden hair gleamed with jewels, and she was dressed in pearly velvet. She beckoned to Veikko and when he came close she said:\n\n“Won’t you come sit beside me?”\n\n“Me? Me?” Veikko stammered, too dazed to think.\n\nThe beautiful creature smiled.\n\n“You were not ashamed to have me for a sweetheart when I was a mouse,” she said, “and surely now that I am a Princess again you won’t desert me!”\n\n“A mouse!” Veikko gasped. “Were you the little mouse?”\n\nThe Princess nodded.\n\n“Yes, I was the little mouse under an evil enchantment which could never have been broken if you had not taken me for a sweetheart and if another human being had not drowned me. Now the enchantment is broken forever. So come, we will go to your father and after he has given us his blessing we will get married and go home to my kingdom.”\n\nAnd that’s exactly what they did. They drove at once to the farmer’s house and when Veikko’s father and his brothers and his brothers’ sweethearts saw the Princess’ coach stopping at their gate they all came out bowing and scraping to see what such grand folk could want of them.\n\n“Father!” Veikko cried, “don’t you know me?”\n\nThe farmer stopped bowing long enough to look up.\n\n“Why, bless my soul!” he cried, “it’s our Veikko!”\n\n“Yes, father, I’m Veikko and this is the Princess that I’m going to marry!”\n\n“A Princess, did you say, Veikko? Mercy me, where did my boy find a Princess?”\n\n“Out in the forest where my tree pointed.”\n\n“Well, well, well,” the farmer said, “where your tree pointed! I’ve always heard that was a good way to find a bride.”\n\nThe older brothers shook their heads gloomily and muttered:\n\n“Just our luck! If only our trees had pointed to the forest we, too, should have found princesses instead of plain country wenches!”\n\nBut they were wrong: it wasn’t because his tree pointed to the forest that Veikko got the Princess, it was because he was so simple and good that he was kind even to a little mouse.\n\nWell, after they had got the farmer’s blessing they rode home to the Princess’ kingdom and were married. And they were happy as they should have been for they were good and true to each other and they loved each other dearly.",

    "content": "Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden.\n\nIt was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them. \"How happy we are here!\" they cried to each other.\n\nOne day the Giant came back. He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years. After the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his own castle. When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away.\n\n\"My own garden is my own garden,\" said the Giant; \"any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.\" So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.\n\nTRESPASSERS\nWILL BE\nPROSECUTED\n\nHe was a very selfish Giant.\n\nThe poor children had now nowhere to play. They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it. They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside. \"How happy we were there,\" they said to each other.\n\nThen the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom. Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep. The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. \"Spring has forgotten this garden,\" they cried, \"so we will live here all the year round.\" The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver. Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came. He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down. \"This is a delightful spot,\" he said, \"we must ask the Hail on a visit.\" So the Hail came. Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.\n\n\"I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,\" said the Selfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden; \"I hope there will be a change in the weather.\"\n\nBut the Spring never came, nor the Summer. The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant's garden she gave none. \"He is too selfish,\" she said. So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.\n\nOne morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music. It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King's musicians passing by. It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world. Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement. \"I believe the Spring has come at last,\" said the Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.\n\nWhat did he see?\n\nHe saw a most wonderful sight. Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees. In every tree that he could see there was a little child. And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children's heads. The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing. It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter. It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy. He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly. The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it. \"Climb up! little boy,\" said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.\n\nAnd the Giant's heart melted as he looked out. \"How selfish I have been!\" he said; \"now I know why the Spring would not come here. I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground for ever and ever.\" He was really very sorry for what he had done.\n\nSo he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden. But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again. Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming. And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree. And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant's neck, and kissed him. And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring. \"It is your garden now, little children,\" said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall. And when the people were going to market at twelve o'clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.\n\nAll day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him good-bye.\n\n\"But where is your little companion?\" he said: \"the boy I put into the tree.\" The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.\n\n\"We don't know,\" answered the children; \"he has gone away.\"\n\n\"You must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow,\" said the Giant. But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.\n\nEvery afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the Giant. But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again. The Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first little friend, and often spoke of him. \"How I would like to see him!\" he used to say.\n\nYears went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble. He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the children at their games, and admired his garden. \"I have many beautiful flowers,\" he said; \"but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all.\"\n\nOne winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing. He did not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring asleep, and that the flowers were resting.\n\nSuddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked. It certainly was a marvellous sight. In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms. Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved.\n\nDownstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden. He hastened across the grass, and came near to the child. And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, \"Who hath dared to wound thee?\" For on the palms of the child's hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.\n\n\"Who hath dared to wound thee?\" cried the Giant; \"tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him.\"\n\n\"Nay!\" answered the child; \"but these are the wounds of Love.\"\n\n\"Who art thou?\" said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.\n\nAnd the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, \"You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise.\"\n\nAnd when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.",

    "content": "High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince. He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.\n\nHe was very much admired indeed. \"He is as beautiful as a weathercock,\" remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; \"only not quite so useful,\" he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.\n\n\"Why can't you be like the Happy Prince?\" asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon. \"The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything.\"\n\n\"I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,\" muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.\n\n\"He looks just like an angel,\" said the Charity Children as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white pinafores.\n\n\"How do you know?\" said the Mathematical Master, \"you have never seen one.\"\n\n\"Ah! but we have, in our dreams,\" answered the children; and the Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of children dreaming.\n\nOne night there flew over the city a little Swallow. His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed. He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.\n\n\"Shall I love you?\" said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow. So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples. This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.\n\n\"It is a ridiculous attachment,\" twittered the other Swallows; \"she has no money, and far too many relations\"; and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds. Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.\n\nAfter they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady- love. \"She has no conversation,\" he said, \"and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.\" And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys. \"I admit that she is domestic,\" he continued, \"but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also.\"\n\n\"Will you come away with me?\" he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her head, she was so attached to her home.\n\n\"You have been trifling with me,\" he cried. \"I am off to the Pyramids. Good-bye!\" and he flew away.\n\nAll day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city. \"Where shall I put up?\" he said; \"I hope the town has made preparations.\"\n\nThen he saw the statue on the tall column.\n\n\"I will put up there,\" he cried; \"it is a fine position, with plenty of fresh air.\" So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.\n\n\"I have a golden bedroom,\" he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him. \"What a curious thing!\" he cried; \"there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining. The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful. The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.\"\n\nThen another drop fell.\n\n\"What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?\" he said; \"I must look for a good chimney-pot,\" and he determined to fly away.\n\nBut before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw - Ah! what did he see?\n\nThe eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks. His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he said.\n\n\"I am the Happy Prince.\"\n\n\"Why are you weeping then?\" asked the Swallow; \"you have quite drenched me.\"\n\n\"When I was alive and had a human heart,\" answered the statue, \"I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans- Souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter. In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall. Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful. My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness. So I lived, and so I died. And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but weep.\"\n\n\"What! is he not solid gold?\" said the Swallow to himself. He was too polite to make any personal remarks out loud.\n\n\"Far away,\" continued the statue in a low musical voice, \"far away in a little street there is a poor house. One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table. Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress. She is embroidering passion- flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen's maids-of- honour to wear at the next Court-ball. In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill. He has a fever, and is asking for oranges. His mother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying. Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt? My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.\"\n\n\"I am waited for in Egypt,\" said the Swallow. \"My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus- flowers. Soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great King. The King is there himself in his painted coffin. He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices. Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves.\"\n\n\"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\" said the Prince, \"will you not stay with me for one night, and be my messenger? The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so sad.\"\n\n\"I don't think I like boys,\" answered the Swallow. \"Last summer, when I was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller's sons, who were always throwing stones at me. They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.\"\n\nBut the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry. \"It is very cold here,\" he said; \"but I will stay with you for one night, and be your messenger.\"\n\n\"Thank you, little Swallow,\" said the Prince.\n\nSo the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince's sword, and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.\n\nHe passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured. He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing. A beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover. \"How wonderful the stars are,\" he said to her, \"and how wonderful is the power of love!\"\n\n\"I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,\" she answered; \"I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the seamstresses are so lazy.\"\n\nHe passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of the ships. He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining with each other, and weighing out money in copper scales. At last he came to the poor house and looked in. The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired. In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman's thimble. Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy's forehead with his wings. \"How cool I feel,\" said the boy, \"I must be getting better\"; and he sank into a delicious slumber.\n\nThen the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had done. \"It is curious,\" he remarked, \"but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold.\"\n\n\"That is because you have done a good action,\" said the Prince. And the little Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep. Thinking always made him sleepy.\n\nWhen day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath. \"What a remarkable phenomenon,\" said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge. \"A swallow in winter!\" And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper. Every one quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand.\n\n\"To-night I go to Egypt,\" said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the prospect. He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of the church steeple. Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each other, \"What a distinguished stranger!\" so he enjoyed himself very much.\n\nWhen the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. \"Have you any commissions for Egypt?\" he cried; \"I am just starting.\"\n\n\"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\" said the Prince, \"will you not stay with me one night longer?\"\n\n\"I am waited for in Egypt,\" answered the Swallow. \"To-morrow my friends will fly up to the Second Cataract. The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon. All night long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent. At noon the yellow lions come down to the water's edge to drink. They have eyes like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.\n\n\"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\" said the Prince, \"far away across the city I see a young man in a garret. He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets. His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes. He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any more. There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.\"\n\n\"I will wait with you one night longer,\" said the Swallow, who really had a good heart. \"Shall I take him another ruby?\"\n\n\"Alas! I have no ruby now,\" said the Prince; \"my eyes are all that I have left. They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago. Pluck out one of them and take it to him. He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish his play.\"\n\n\"Dear Prince,\" said the Swallow, \"I cannot do that\"; and he began to weep.\n\n\"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\" said the Prince, \"do as I command you.\"\n\nSo the Swallow plucked out the Prince's eye, and flew away to the student's garret. It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof. Through this he darted, and came into the room. The young man had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the bird's wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets.\n\n\"I am beginning to be appreciated,\" he cried; \"this is from some great admirer. Now I can finish my play,\" and he looked quite happy.\n\nThe next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour. He sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes. \"Heave a-hoy!\" they shouted as each chest came up. \"I am going to Egypt\"! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.\n\n\"I am come to bid you good-bye,\" he cried.\n\n\"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\" said the Prince, \"will you not stay with me one night longer?\"\n\n\"It is winter,\" answered the Swallow, \"and the chill snow will soon be here. In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them. My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other. Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away. The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.\"\n\n\"In the square below,\" said the Happy Prince, \"there stands a little match-girl. She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled. Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying. She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare. Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will not beat her.\"\n\n\"I will stay with you one night longer,\" said the Swallow, \"but I cannot pluck out your eye. You would be quite blind then.\"\n\n\"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\" said the Prince, \"do as I command you.\"\n\nSo he plucked out the Prince's other eye, and darted down with it. He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand. \"What a lovely bit of glass,\" cried the little girl; and she ran home, laughing.\n\nThen the Swallow came back to the Prince. \"You are blind now,\" he said, \"so I will stay with you always.\"\n\n\"No, little Swallow,\" said the poor Prince, \"you must go away to Egypt.\"\n\n\"I will stay with you always,\" said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's feet.\n\nAll the next day he sat on the Prince's shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands. He told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the butterflies.\n\n\"Dear little Swallow,\" said the Prince, \"you tell me of marvellous things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women. There is no Mystery so great as Misery. Fly over my city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see there.\"\n\nSo the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates. He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets. Under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one another's arms to try and keep themselves warm. \"How hungry we are!\" they said. \"You must not lie here,\" shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.\n\nThen he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.\n\n\"I am covered with fine gold,\" said the Prince, \"you must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold can make them happy.\"\n\nLeaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey. Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the children's faces grew rosier, and they laughed and played games in the street. \"We have bread now!\" they cried.\n\nThen the snow came, and after the snow came the frost. The streets looked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and glistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice.\n\nThe poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he loved him too well. He picked up crumbs outside the baker's door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.\n\nBut at last he knew that he was going to die. He had just strength to fly up to the Prince's shoulder once more. \"Good-bye, dear Prince!\" he murmured, \"will you let me kiss your hand?\"\n\n\"I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,\" said the Prince, \"you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips, for I love you.\"\n\n\"It is not to Egypt that I am going,\" said the Swallow. \"I am going to the House of Death. Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?\"\n\nAnd he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet.\n\nAt that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken. The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two. It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.\n\nEarly the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors. As they passed the column he looked up at the statue: \"Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!\" he said.\n\n\"How shabby indeed!\" cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with the Mayor; and they went up to look at it.\n\n\"The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer,\" said the Mayor in fact, \"he is litttle beter than a beggar!\"\n\n\"Little better than a beggar,\" said the Town Councillors.\n\n\"And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!\" continued the Mayor. \"We must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die here.\" And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.\n\nSo they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince. \"As he is no longer beautiful he is no longer useful,\" said the Art Professor at the University.\n\nThen they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal. \"We must have another statue, of course,\" he said, \"and it shall be a statue of myself.\"\n\n\"Of myself,\" said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled. When I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.\n\n\"What a strange thing!\" said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry. \"This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace. We must throw it away.\" So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also lying.\n\n\"Bring me the two most precious things in the city,\" said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.\n\n\"You have rightly chosen,\" said God, \"for in my garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy Prince shall praise me.\"",

    "content": "Maria, from an upper window, spied the children coming, tugging the basket along.\n\nShe called down to Old Uncle and Aunt Susan on the piazza.\n\n“If them children ar’n’t bringing home a cub!”\n\nOld Uncle stirred in his hammock. Aunt Susan went down the steps. “What will they do next?” said Old Uncle. As the twins came up with a joyful outcry, to exhibit their treasure, he rose and peered into the basket. “’Tis a cub surely,” he said. He looked at the children from under his shaggy eyebrows. “Will you fetch in a catamount to-morrow?” he asked sternly.\n\n“We—we thought you would be pleased,” Essie faltered.\n\n“Why, Uncle,” cried Ally, “why, Old Uncle, don’t you love a baby bear? I just want you to see him suck my fingers! You can’t help loving him!”\n\n“I love you,” teased Old Uncle, catching her up to a place in the hammock beside himself. “But you can’t keep him alive on your fingers, even if he only sucked up one a day.”\n\n“You’re just funning!” said Ally. “Pincher knows how to feed him, and so does Michael. I reckon Essie and I could too.”\n\n“Old Uncle, we won’t let him be a bit of trouble,” said Essie.\n\n“Of course he won’t be any trouble,” said Aunt Susan. She and Aunt Rose had brought a bottle of warm milk with a rag over the top of it. They put it into the little bear’s mouth, and the whole family gathered round to see him take his dinner. His grunts of satisfaction were very funny. At last the little fellow let go the bottle, stretched himself, and rolled over on the grass, and looked so good-natured you would almost have said he was laughing; and Aunt Susan said, “A little bear is a little dear!”\n\nThe cub must have been pretty tired with all the attention and endearments he received that day, not to say anything about Master Will’s efforts to make him stand on his hind legs, when he tumbled over every time like a mould of jelly.\n\nBut at last, and after his supper, he was put to sleep in the shed on a little truss of hay, under an old blanket, where, as soon as he was alone, he began to whimper for his mother. But the children did not hear him; they had trooped up-stairs to their own beds, all of them as tired as the cub himself, and were presently sound asleep.\n\nThe great moon rose white and solemn above the hills, and poured her silver over the forests, and the whole world seemed asleep too.\n\nIt was just in their first sweet slumber that everyone in that house was waked by the strangest, the most melancholy, the most frightful sound they had ever heard. Now it was loud, high, and shrill. “Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!” it came. Now it was a long, low growl. Now again it was a series of sharp cries like barks. Now it was a roar; and something was knocking about the chairs on the piazzas, scratching at the windows, lumbering down the steps and plowing and plunging over the grass—something with heavy jaws and coming clap, clap, along the front of the house. Finally it made off clumsily in the direction of the shed, and raised such an uproar there that the sky rang with it.\n\nEvery one was out of bed and at the windows. The twins, half hiding behind the curtains in fright, shivered as they saw plainly in the moonlight a big creature standing erect, cuffing away at the side of the shed, and whining and growling all the more when a little whine and a little yelp answered from within.\n\nPincher saw the children, and laughed. He was standing at the window at the other end of the long hall.\n\n“It’s Mother Bear,” he called. “Hear her! ‘Where’s my little bear?’ she’s askin’. ‘Where’s my baby? You folks, give him back or I’ll eat your babies. Little Bruin, I’m a-hearin’ of ye. Ye want your mammy, don’t you? She’s smelled ye all the way here. How ’m I goin’ ter fetch ye out blest ef I know! But I’m goin’ ter fetch ye! I say! Give me my little bear! He’s a dreffle bright bear! Ef you folks only seen him eatin’ of blackberries you’d know how smart he wuz. Say, I jest can’t lend him! I’ve got to get him real fat ’fore we go into winter quarters. How’d ye get here, any way, ye little scamp? Can’t I leave ye five minutes? Ye was safe asleep in a soft holler, an’ then w’en I was wadin’ inter the river with a bee-hive in my arms, so’s to drown the bees an’ git the honey, off ye go! Don’t ye know little bears should mind their mother? Oh, somebody tuk ye. Br-r-r! I won’t leave so much as their aprons if I can lay paws on them! that is, onless so be it’s Ally and Essie. But I’ll hev to box their ears for ’em, I guess. I say, now, folks! Br-r-r! Br-r-r! I’ll tear the place down if ye don’t give me my cub!’”\n\n“Oh, Pincher! does she say all that?” asked Ally.\n\n“Pincher! would she tear the house down?” cried Essie.\n\n“The poor mother!” Aunt Susan was exclaiming, hurrying into her dressing-gown and slippers. And then she and Old Uncle ran down the back way, followed by Pincher; and they took up the cub, and opened the shed-door a crack, and pushed him through, and banged and bolted the door behind him.\n\nEverybody looked out that could. The mother bear stood off a moment on her hind legs. Then she fell on the cub like an avalanche, and held him in her arms as any mother holds her baby, and licked him from top to toe, and lay down and gave him his dinner. After that, gazing back at the house every step or two with a growl, she lurched off, little Bruin laboriously following. But Pincher declared that the last he saw, as he watched her out of sight, she was up on her hind legs carrying her baby in her arms like anybody.\n\nThe twins watched as long as they could see her. Then Essie began to cry. “I wanted to keep him,” she said, “I—I loved him so.”\n\n“So did I,” said Ally, with her arms round Essie. “But I guess, Essie, we’ll have to get along with Bobbo. I wonder how Pincher knew his name was Bruin. Some day we’ll go into the woods, and call ‘Bruin, Bruin,’ and perhaps he will remember us. His mother loved him, you know, Essie. I suppose she was so sorry when she found him gone. Mothers must have their babies, you know, Essie; why, they belong to them!”\n\n“If you foolish children don’t go to sleep,” cried Uncle Billy from some remote quarter, “I’ll call Mother Bear back!”\n\n“Oh! do you believe you could?” answered Ally. “Oh, Uncle Billy! I wish you would.”",

    "content": "In the forest, high up on the steep shore, and not far from the open seacoast, stood a very old oak-tree. It was just three hundred and sixty-five years old, but that long time was to the tree as the same number of days might be to us; we wake by day and sleep by night, and then we have our dreams. It is different with the tree; it is obliged to keep awake through three seasons of the year, and does not get any sleep till winter comes. Winter is its time for rest; its night after the long day of spring, summer, and autumn. On many a warm summer, the Ephemera, the flies that exist for only a day, had fluttered about the old oak, enjoyed life and felt happy and if, for a moment, one of the tiny creatures rested on one of his large fresh leaves, the tree would always say, “Poor little creature! your whole life consists only of a single day. How very short. It must be quite melancholy.”\n\n“Melancholy! what do you mean?” the little creature would always reply. “Everything around me is so wonderfully bright and warm, and beautiful, that it makes me joyous.”\n\n“But only for one day, and then it is all over.”\n\n“Over!” repeated the fly; “what is the meaning of all over? Are you all over too?”\n\n“No; I shall very likely live for thousands of your days, and my day is whole seasons long; indeed it is so long that you could never reckon it out.”\n\n“No? then I don’t understand you. You may have thousands of my days, but I have thousands of moments in which I can be merry and happy. Does all the beauty of the world cease when you die?”\n\n“No,” replied the tree; “it will certainly last much longer,— infinitely longer than I can even think of.” “Well, then,” said the little fly, “we have the same time to live; only we reckon differently.” And the little creature danced and floated in the air, rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet, rejoicing in the balmy breezes, laden with the fragrance of clover-fields and wild roses, elder-blossoms and honeysuckle, from the garden hedges, wild thyme, primroses, and mint, and the scent of all these was so strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly. The long and beautiful day had been so full of joy and sweet delights, that when the sun sank low it felt tired of all its happiness and enjoyment. Its wings could sustain it no longer, and gently and slowly it glided down upon the soft waving blades of grass, nodded its little head as well as it could nod, and slept peacefully and sweetly. The fly was dead.\n\n“Poor little Ephemera!” said the oak; “what a terribly short life!” And so, on every summer day the dance was repeated, the same questions asked, and the same answers given. The same thing was continued through many generations of Ephemera; all of them felt equally merry and equally happy.\n\nThe oak remained awake through the morning of spring, the noon of summer, and the evening of autumn; its time of rest, its night drew nigh—winter was coming. Already the storms were singing, “Good-night, good-night.” Here fell a leaf and there fell a leaf. “We will rock you and lull you. Go to sleep, go to sleep. We will sing you to sleep, and shake you to sleep, and it will do your old twigs good; they will even crackle with pleasure. Sleep sweetly, sleep sweetly, it is your three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth night. Correctly speaking, you are but a youngster in the world. Sleep sweetly, the clouds will drop snow upon you, which will be quite a cover-lid, warm and sheltering to your feet. Sweet sleep to you, and pleasant dreams.” And there stood the oak, stripped of all its leaves, left to rest during the whole of a long winter, and to dream many dreams of events that had happened in its life, as in the dreams of men. The great tree had once been small; indeed, in its cradle it had been an acorn. According to human computation, it was now in the fourth century of its existence. It was the largest and best tree in the forest. Its summit towered above all the other trees, and could be seen far out at sea, so that it served as a landmark to the sailors. It had no idea how many eyes looked eagerly for it. In its topmost branches the wood-pigeon built her nest, and the cuckoo carried out his usual vocal performances, and his well-known notes echoed amid the boughs; and in autumn, when the leaves looked like beaten copper plates, the birds of passage would come and rest upon the branches before taking their flight across the sea. But now it was winter, the tree stood leafless, so that every one could see how crooked and bent were the branches that sprang forth from the trunk. Crows and rooks came by turns and sat on them, and talked of the hard times which were beginning, and how difficult it was in winter to obtain food.\n\nIt was just about holy Christmas time that the tree dreamed a dream. The tree had, doubtless, a kind of feeling that the festive time had arrived, and in his dream fancied he heard the bells ringing from all the churches round, and yet it seemed to him to be a beautiful summer’s day, mild and warm. His mighty summits was crowned with spreading fresh green foliage; the sunbeams played among the leaves and branches, and the air was full of fragrance from herb and blossom; painted butterflies chased each other; the summer flies danced around him, as if the world had been created merely for them to dance and be merry in. All that had happened to the tree during every year of his life seemed to pass before him, as in a festive procession. He saw the knights of olden times and noble ladies ride by through the wood on their gallant steeds, with plumes waving in their hats, and falcons on their wrists. The hunting horn sounded, and the dogs barked. He saw hostile warriors, in colored dresses and glittering armor, with spear and halberd, pitching their tents, and anon striking them. The watchfires again blazed, and men sang and slept under the hospitable shelter of the tree. He saw lovers meet in quiet happiness near him in the moonshine, and carve the initials of their names in the grayish-green bark on his trunk. Once, but long years had intervened since then, guitars and Eolian harps had been hung on his boughs by merry travellers; now they seemed to hang there again, and he could hear their marvellous tones. The wood-pigeons cooed as if to explain the feelings of the tree, and the cuckoo called out to tell him how many summer days he had yet to live. Then it seemed as if new life was thrilling through every fibre of root and stem and leaf, rising even to the highest branches. The tree felt itself stretching and spreading out, while through the root beneath the earth ran the warm vigor of life. As he grew higher and still higher, with increased strength, his topmost boughs became broader and fuller; and in proportion to his growth, so was his self-satisfaction increased, and with it arose a joyous longing to grow higher and higher, to reach even to the warm, bright sun itself. Already had his topmost branches pierced the clouds, which floated beneath them like troops of birds of passage, or large white swans; every leaf seemed gifted with sight, as if it possessed eyes to see. The stars became visible in broad daylight, large and sparkling, like clear and gentle eyes. They recalled to the memory the well-known look in the eyes of a child, or in the eyes of lovers who had once met beneath the branches of the old oak. These were wonderful and happy moments for the old tree, full of peace and joy; and yet, amidst all this happiness, the tree felt a yearning, longing desire that all the other trees, bushes, herbs, and flowers beneath him, might be able also to rise higher, as he had done, and to see all this splendor, and experience the same happiness. The grand, majestic oak could not be quite happy in the midst of his enjoyment, while all the rest, both great and small, were not with him. And this feeling of yearning trembled through every branch, through every leaf, as warmly and fervently as if they had been the fibres of a human heart. The summit of the tree waved to and fro, and bent downwards as if in his silent longing he sought for something. Then there came to him the fragrance of thyme, followed by the more powerful scent of honeysuckle and violets; and he fancied he heard the note of the cuckoo. At length his longing was satisfied. Up through the clouds came the green summits of the forest trees, and beneath him, the oak saw them rising, and growing higher and higher. Bush and herb shot upward, and some even tore themselves up by the roots to rise more quickly. The birch-tree was the quickest of all. Like a lightning flash the slender stem shot upwards in a zigzag line, the branches spreading around it like green gauze and banners. Every native of the wood, even to the brown and feathery rushes, grew with the rest, while the birds ascended with the melody of song. On a blade of grass, that fluttered in the air like a long, green ribbon, sat a grasshopper, cleaning his wings with his legs. May beetles hummed, the bees murmured, the birds sang, each in his own way; the air was filled with the sounds of song and gladness.\n\n“But where is the little blue flower that grows by the water?” asked the oak, “and the purple bell-flower, and the daisy?” You see the oak wanted to have them all with him.\n\n“Here we are, we are here,” sounded in voice and song.\n\n“But the beautiful thyme of last summer, where is that? and the lilies-of-the-valley, which last year covered the earth with their bloom? and the wild apple-tree with its lovely blossoms, and all the glory of the wood, which has flourished year after year? even what may have but now sprouted forth could be with us here.”\n\n“We are here, we are here,” sounded voices higher in the air, as if they had flown there beforehand.\n\n“Why this is beautiful, too beautiful to be believed,” said the oak in a joyful tone. “I have them all here, both great and small; not one has been forgotten. Can such happiness be imagined?” It seemed almost impossible.\n\n“In heaven with the Eternal God, it can be imagined, and it is possible,” sounded the reply through the air.\n\nAnd the old tree, as it still grew upwards and onwards, felt that his roots were loosening themselves from the earth.\n\n“It is right so, it is best,” said the tree, “no fetters hold me now. I can fly up to the very highest point in light and glory. And all I love are with me, both small and great. All—all are here.”\n\nSuch was the dream of the old oak: and while he dreamed, a mighty storm came rushing over land and sea, at the holy Christmas time. The sea rolled in great billows towards the shore. There was a cracking and crushing heard in the tree. The root was torn from the ground just at the moment when in his dream he fancied it was being loosened from the earth. He fell—his three hundred and sixty-five years were passed as the single day of the Ephemera. On the morning of Christmas-day, when the sun rose, the storm had ceased. From all the churches sounded the festive bells, and from every hearth, even of the smallest hut, rose the smoke into the blue sky, like the smoke from the festive thank-offerings on the Druids’ altars. The sea gradually became calm, and on board a great ship that had withstood the tempest during the night, all the flags were displayed, as a token of joy and festivity. “The tree is down! The old oak,—our landmark on the coast!” exclaimed the sailors. “It must have fallen in the storm of last night. Who can replace it? Alas! no one.” This was a funeral oration over the old tree; short, but well-meant. There it lay stretched on the snow-covered shore, and over it sounded the notes of a song from the ship—a song of Christmas joy, and of the redemption of the soul of man, and of eternal life through Christ’s atoning blood.\n\n“Sing aloud on the happy morn,\nAll is fulfilled, for Christ is born;\nWith songs of joy let us loudly sing,\n‘Hallelujahs to Christ our King.’”\nThus sounded the old Christmas carol, and every one on board the ship felt his thoughts elevated, through the song and the prayer, even as the old tree had felt lifted up in its last, its beautiful dream on that Christmas morn.",

    "content": "Once, in the old, old times a fountain gushed out of a hill-side, in the marvellous land of Greece. And, for aught I know, after so many thousand years, it is still gushing out of the very selfsame spot. At any rate, there was the pleasant fountain, welling freshly forth and sparkling adown the hill-side, in the golden sunset, when a handsome young man named Bellerophon drew near its margin. In his hand he held a bridle, studded with brilliant gems, and adorned with a golden bit. Seeing an old man, and another of middle age, and a little boy, near the fountain, and likewise a maiden, who was dipping up some of the water in a pitcher, he paused, and begged that he might refresh himself with a draught.\n\n“This is very delicious water,” he said to the maiden as he rinsed and filled her pitcher, after drinking out of it. “Will you be kind enough to tell me whether the fountain has any name?”\n\n“Yes; it is called the Fountain of Pirene,” answered the maiden; and then she added, “My grandmother has told me that this clear fountain was once a beautiful woman; and when her son was killed by the arrows of the huntress Diana, she melted all away into tears. And so the water, which you find so cool and sweet, is the sorrow of that poor mother’s heart!”\n\n“I should not have dreamed,” observed the young stranger, “that so clear a well-spring with its gush and gurgle, and its cheery dance out of the shade into the sunlight, had so much as one tear-drop in its bosom! And this, then, is Pirene? I thank you, pretty maiden, for telling me its name. I have come from a far-away country to find this very spot.”\n\nA middle-aged country fellow (he had driven his cow to drink out of the spring) stared hard at young Bellerophon, and at the handsome bridle which he carried in his hand.\n\n“The water-courses must be getting low, friend, in your part of the world,” remarked he, “if you come so far only to find the Fountain of Pirene. But, pray, have you lost a horse? I see you carry the bridle in your hand; and a very pretty one it is with that double row of bright stones upon it. If the horse was as fine as the bridle, you are much to be pitied for losing him.”\n\n“I have lost no horse,” said Bellerophon, with a smile. “But I happen to be seeking a very famous one, which, as wise people have informed me, must be found hereabouts, if anywhere. Do you know whether the winged horse Pegasus still haunts the Fountain of Pirene, as he used to do in your forefathers’ days?”\n\nBut then the country fellow laughed.\n\nSome of you, my little friends, have probably heard that this Pegasus was a snow-white steed, with beautiful silvery wings, who spent most of his time on the summit of Mount Helicon. He was as wild, and as swift, and as buoyant, in his flight through the air, as any eagle that ever soared into the clouds. There was nothing else like him in the world. He had no mate; he never had been backed or bridled by a master; and, for many a long year, he led a solitary and a happy life.\n\nOh, how fine a thing it is to be a winged horse! Sleeping at night, as he did, on a lofty mountain-top, and passing the greater part of the day in the air, Pegasus seemed hardly to be a creature of the earth. Whenever he was seen, up very high above people’s heads, with the sunshine on his silvery wings, you would have thought that he belonged to the sky, and that, skimming a little too low, he had got astray among our mists and vapors, and was seeking his way back again. It was very pretty to behold him plunge into the fleecy bosom of a bright cloud, and be lost in it, for a moment or two, and then break forth from the other side. Or, in a sullen rainstorm, when there was a gray pavement of clouds over the whole sky, it would sometimes happen that the winged horse descended right through it, and the glad light of the upper region would gleam after him. In another instant, it is true, both Pegasus and the pleasant light would be gone away together. But any one that was fortunate enough to see this wondrous spectacle felt cheerful the whole day afterward, and as much longer as the storm lasted.\n\nIn the summer-time and in the beautifulest of weather, Pegasus often alighted on the solid earth, and, closing his silvery wings, would gallop over hill and dale for pastime as fleetly as the wind. Oftener than in any other place, he had been seen near the Fountain of Pirene, drinking the delicious water, or rolling himself upon the soft grass of the margin. Sometimes, too (but Pegasus was very dainty in his food), he would crop a few of the clover-blossoms that happened to be sweetest.\n\nTo the Fountain of Pirene, therefore, people’s great-grandfathers had been in the habit of going (as long as they were youthful, and retained their faith in winged horses), in hopes of getting a glimpse at the beautiful Pegasus. But, of late years, he had been very seldom seen. Indeed, there were many of the country folks, dwelling within half an hour’s walk of the fountain, who had never beheld Pegasus, and did not believe that there was any such creature in existence. The country fellow to whom Bellerophon was speaking chanced to be one of those incredulous persons.\n\nAnd that was the reason why he laughed.\n\n“Pegasus, indeed!” cried he, turning up his nose as high as such a flat nose could be turned up—“Pegasus, indeed! A winged horse, truly! Why, friend, are you in your senses? Of what use would wings be to a horse? Could he drag the plow so well, think you? To be sure, there might be a little saving in the expense of shoes; but then, how would a man like to see his horse flying out of the stable window?—yes, or whisking him up above the clouds, when he only wanted to ride to the mill? No, no! I don’t believe in Pegasus. There never was such a ridiculous kind of a horse-fowl made!”\n\n“I have some reason to think otherwise,” said Bellerophon, quietly.\n\nAnd then he turned to an old gray man, who was leaning on a staff, and listening very attentively, with his head stretched forward, and one hand at his ear, because, for the last twenty years, he had been getting rather deaf.\n\n“And what say you, venerable sir?” inquired he. “In your younger days, I should imagine, you must frequently have seen the winged steed!”\n\n“Ah, young stranger, my memory is very poor!” said the aged man. “When I was a lad, if I remember rightly, I used to believe there was such a horse, and so did everybody else. But nowadays, I hardly know what to think, and very seldom think about the winged horse at all. If I ever saw the creature, it was a long, long while ago; and, to tell you the truth, I doubt whether I ever did see him. One day, to be sure, when I was quite a youth, I remember seeing some hoof-tramps round about the brink of the fountain. Pegasus might have made those hoof-marks; and so might some other horse.”\n\n“And have you never seen him, my fair maiden?” asked Bellerophon of the girl, who stood with the pitcher on her head, while this talk went on. “You certainly could see Pegasus, if anybody can, for your eyes are very bright.”\n\n“Once I thought I saw him,” replied the maiden, with a smile and a blush. “It was either Pegasus, or a large white bird, a very great way up in the air. And one other time, as I was coming to the fountain with my pitcher, I heard a neigh. Oh, such a brisk and melodious neigh as that was! My very heart leaped with delight at the sound. But it startled me, nevertheless; so that I ran home without filling my pitcher.”\n\n“That was truly a pity!” said Bellerophon.\n\nAnd he turned to the child, whom I mentioned at the beginning of the story, and who was gazing at him, as children are apt to gaze at strangers, with his rosy mouth wide open.\n\n“Well, my little fellow,” cried Bellerophon, playfully pulling one of his curls, “I suppose you have often seen the winged horse.”\n\n“That I have,” answered the child, very readily. “I saw him yesterday, and many times before.”\n\n“You are a fine little man!” said Bellerophon, drawing the child closer to him. “Come, tell me all about it.”\n\n“Why,” replied the child, “I often come here to sail little boats in the fountain, and to gather pretty pebbles out of its basin. And sometimes, when I look down into the water, I see the image of the winged horse, in the picture of the sky that is there. I wish he would come down, and take me on his back, and let me ride him up to the moon! But, if I so much as stir to look at him, he flies far away out of sight.”\n\nAnd Bellerophon put his faith in the child, who had seen the image of Pegasus in the water, and in the maiden, who had heard him neigh so melodiously, rather than in the middle-aged clown, who believed only in cart-horses, or in the old man who had forgotten the beautiful things of his youth.\n\nTherefore, he haunted about the Fountain of Pirene for a great many days afterward. He kept continually on the watch, looking upward at the sky, or else down into the water, hoping forever that he should see either the reflected image of the winged horse, or the marvellous reality. He held the bridle, with its bright gems and golden bit, always ready in his hand. The rustic people, who dwelt in the neighborhood, and drove their cattle to the fountain to drink, would often laugh at poor Bellerophon, and sometimes take him pretty severely to task. They told him that an able-bodied young man, like himself, ought to have better business than to be wasting his time in such an idle pursuit. They offered to sell him a horse, if he wanted one; and when Bellerophon declined the purchase, they tried to drive a bargain with him for his fine bridle.\n\nEven the country boys thought him so very foolish, that they used to have a great deal of sport about him, and were rude enough not to care a fig, although Bellerophon saw and heard it. One little urchin, for example, would play Pegasus, and cut the oddest imaginable capers, by way of flying; while one of his school-fellows would scamper after him, holding forth a twist of bulrushes, which was intended to represent Bellerophon’s ornamental bridle. But the gentle child, who had seen the picture of Pegasus in the water, comforted the young stranger more than all the naughty boys could torment him. The dear little fellow, in his play-hours, often sat down beside him, and, without speaking a word, would look down into the fountain and up toward the sky, with so innocent a faith, that Bellerophon could not help feeling encouraged.\n\nNow you will, perhaps, wish to be told why it was that Bellerophon had undertaken to catch the winged horse. And we shall find no better opportunity to speak about this matter than while he is waiting for Pegasus to appear.\n\nIf I were to relate the whole of Bellerophon’s previous adventures, they might easily grow into a very long story. It will be quite enough to say, that, in a certain country in Asia, a terrible monster, called a Chimæra, had made its appearance, and was doing more mischief than could be talked about between now and sunset. According to the best accounts which I have been able to obtain, this Chimæra was nearly, if not quite the ugliest and most poisonous creature, and the strangest and unaccountablest, and the hardest to fight with, and the most difficult to run away from, that ever came out of the earth’s inside. It had a tail like a boa-constrictor; its body was like I do not care what; and it had three separate heads, one of which was a lion’s, the second a goat’s, and the third an abominably great snake’s. And a hot blast of fire came flaming out of each of its three mouths! Being an earthly monster, I doubt whether it had any wings; but, wings or no, it ran like a goat and a lion, and wriggled along like a serpent, and thus[59] contrived to make about as much speed as all the three together.\n\nOh, the mischief, and mischief, and mischief that this naughty creature did! With its flaming breath, it could set a forest on fire, or burn up a field of grain, or, for that matter, a village, with all its fences and houses. It laid waste the whole country round about, and used to eat up people and animals alive, and cook them afterward in the burning oven of its stomach. Mercy on us, little children, I hope neither you nor I will ever happen to meet a Chimæra!\n\nWhile the hateful beast (if a beast we can anywise call it) was doing all these horrible things, it so chanced that Bellerophon came to that part of the world, on a visit to the king. The king’s name was Iobates, and Lycia was the country which he ruled over. Bellerophon was one of the bravest youths in the world, and desired nothing so much as to do some valiant and beneficent deed, such as would make all mankind admire and love him. In those days, the only way for a young man to distinguish himself was by fighting battles, either with the enemies of his country, or with wicked giants, or with troublesome dragons, or with wild beasts, when he could find nothing more dangerous to encounter.\n\nKing Iobates perceiving the courage of his youthful visitor, proposed to him to go and fight the Chimæra, which everybody else was afraid of, and which, unless it should be soon killed, was likely to convert Lycia into a desert. Bellerophon hesitated not a moment, but assured the king that he would either slay this dreaded Chimæra, or perish in the attempt.\n\nBut, in the first place, as the monster was so prodigiously swift, he bethought himself that he should never win the victory by fighting on foot. The wisest thing he could do, therefore, was to get the very best and fleetest horse that could anywhere be found. And what other horse, in all the world, was half so fleet as the marvellous horse Pegasus, who had wings as well as legs, and was even more active in the air than on the earth? To be sure, a great many people denied that there was any such horse with wings, and said that the stories about him were all poetry and nonsense. But, wonderful as it appeared, Bellerophon believed that Pegasus was a real steed, and hoped that he himself might be fortunate enough to find him; and, once fairly mounted on his back, he would be able to fight the Chimæra at better advantage.\n\nAnd this was the purpose with which he had travelled from Lycia to Greece, and had brought the beautifully ornamental bridle in his hand. It was an enchanted bridle. If he could only succeed in putting the golden bit into the mouth of Pegasus, the winged horse would be submissive, and would own Bellerophon for his master, and fly whithersoever he might choose to turn the rein.\n\nBut, indeed, it was a weary and anxious time, while Bellerophon waited and waited for Pegasus, in hopes that he would come and drink at the Fountain of Pirene. He was afraid lest King Iobates should imagine that he had fled from the Chimæra. It pained him, too, to think how much mischief the monster was doing, while he himself, instead of fighting with it, was compelled to sit idly poring over the bright waters of Pirene, as they gushed out of the sparkling sand. And as Pegasus came thither so seldom in these latter years, and scarcely alighted there more than once in a lifetime, Bellerophon feared that he might grow an old man, and have no strength left in his arms nor courage in his heart, before the winged horse would appear. Oh, how heavily passes the time, while an adventurous youth is yearning to do his part in life and to gather in the harvest of his renown! How hard a lesson it is to wait! Our life is brief, and how much of it is spent in teaching us only this!\n\nWell was it for Bellerophon that the gentle child had grown so fond of him, and was never weary of keeping him company. Every morning the child gave him a new hope to put in his bosom, instead of yesterday’s withered one.\n\n“Dear Bellerophon,” he would cry, looking up hopefully into his face, “I think we shall see Pegasus to-day!”\n\nAnd, at length, if it had not been for the little boy’s unwavering faith, Bellerophon would have given up all hope, and would have gone back to Lycia, and have done his best to slay the Chimæra without the help of the winged horse. And in that case poor Bellerophon would at least have been terribly scorched by the creature’s breath, and would most probably have been killed and devoured. Nobody should ever try to fight an earth-born Chimæra, unless he can first get upon the back of an aërial steed.\n\nOne morning the child spoke to Bellerophon even more hopefully than usual.\n\n“Dear, dear Bellerophon,” cried he, “I know not why it is, but I feel as if we should certainly see Pegasus to-day!”\n\nAnd all that day he would not stir a step from Bellerophon’s side; so they ate a crust of bread together and drank some of the water of the fountain. In the afternoon, there they sat, and Bellerophon had thrown his arm around the child, who likewise had put one of his little hands into Bellerophon’s.\n\nThe latter was lost in his own thoughts, and was fixing his eyes vacantly on the trunks of the trees that overshadowed the fountain, and on the grapevines that clambered up among their branches. But the gentle child was gazing down into the water; he was grieved, for Bellerophon’s sake, that the hope of another day should be deceived, like so many before it; and two or three quiet tear-drops fell from his eyes, and mingled with what were said to be the many tears of Pirene, when she wept for her slain children.\n\nBut, when he least thought of it, Bellerophon felt the pressure of the child’s little hand, and heard a soft, almost breathless, whisper.\n\n“See there, dear Bellerophon! There is an image in the water!”\n\nThe young man looked down into the dimpling mirror of the fountain, and saw what he took to be the reflection of a bird which seemed to be flying at a great height in the air, with a gleam of sunshine on its snowy or silvery wings.\n\n“What a splendid bird it must be!” said he. “And how very large it looks, though it must really be flying higher than the clouds!”\n\n“It makes me tremble!” whispered the child. “I am afraid to look up into the air! It is very beautiful, and yet I dare only look at its image in the water. Dear Bellerophon, do you not see that it is no bird? It is the winged horse Pegasus!”\n\nBellerophon’s heart began to throb! He gazed keenly upward, but could not see the winged creature, whether bird or horse; because, just then, it had plunged into the fleecy depths of a summer cloud. It was but a moment, however, before the object reappeared, sinking lightly down out of the cloud, although still at a vast distance from the earth.\n\nBellerophon caught the child in his arms, and shrank back with him, so that they were both hidden among the thick shrubbery which grew all around the fountain. Not that he was afraid of any harm, but he dreaded lest, if Pegasus caught a glimpse of them, he would fly far away, and alight in some inaccessible mountain-top. For it was really the winged horse. After they had expected him so long, he was coming to quench his thirst with the water of Pirene.\n\nNearer and nearer came the aërial wonder, flying in great circles, as you may have seen a dove when about to alight. Downward came Pegasus, in those wide, sweeping circles, which grew narrower, and narrower still, as he gradually approached the earth. The nigher the view of him, the more beautiful he was, and the more marvellous the sweep of his silvery wings. At last, with so light a pressure as hardly to bend the grass about the fountain, or imprint a hoof-tramp in the sand of its margin, he alighted, and, stooping his wild head, began to drink. He drew in the water, with long and pleasant sighs, and tranquil pauses of enjoyment; and then another draught, and another, and another. For, nowhere in the world, or up among the clouds, did Pegasus love any water as he loved this of Pirene. And when his thirst was slaked, he cropped a few of the honey-blossoms of the clover, delicately tasting them, but not caring to make a hearty meal, because the herbage, just beneath the clouds, on the lofty sides of Mount Helicon, suited his palate better than this ordinary grass.\n\nAfter thus drinking to his heart’s content, and in his dainty fashion, condescending to take a little food, the winged horse began to caper to and fro, and dance as it were, out of mere idleness and sport. There never was a more playful creature made than this very Pegasus. So there he frisked, in a way that it delights me to think about, fluttering his great wings as lightly as ever did a linnet, and running little races, half on earth and half in the air, and which I know not whether to call a flight or a gallop. When a creature is perfectly able to fly, he sometimes chooses to run, just for the pastime of the thing; and so did Pegasus, although it cost him some little trouble to keep his hoofs so near the ground. Bellerophon, meanwhile, holding the child’s hand, peeped forth from the shrubbery, and thought that never was any sight so beautiful as this, nor ever a horse’s eyes so wild and spirited as those of Pegasus. It seemed a sin to think of bridling him and riding on his back.\n\nOnce or twice Pegasus stopped, and snuffed the air, pricking up his ears, tossing his head, and turning it on all sides, as if he partly suspected some mischief or other. Seeing nothing, however, and hearing no sound, he soon began his antics again.\n\nAt length—not that he was weary, but only idle and luxurious—Pegasus folded his wings, and lay down on the soft green turf. But, being too full of aërial life to remain quiet for many moments together, he soon rolled over on his back, with his four slender legs in the air. It was beautiful to see him, this one solitary creature, whose mate had never been created, but who needed no companion, and, living a great many hundred years, was as happy as the centuries were long. The more he did such things as mortal horses are accustomed to do, the less earthly and the more wonderful he seemed. Bellerophon and the child almost held their breath, partly from a delightful awe, but still more because they dreaded lest the slightest stir or murmur should send him up, with the speed of an arrow-flight, into the furthest blue of the sky.\n\nFinally, when he had enough of rolling over and over, Pegasus turned himself about, and, indolently, like any other horse, put out his fore legs, in order to rise from the ground; and Bellerophon, who had guessed that he would do so, darted suddenly from the thicket, and leaped astride of his back.\n\nYes, there he sat, on the back of the winged horse!\n\nBut what a bound did Pegasus make, when for the first time, he felt the weight of a mortal man upon his loins! A bound, indeed! Before he had time to draw a breath, Bellerophon found himself five hundred feet aloft, and still shooting upward, while the winged horse snorted and trembled with terror and anger. Upward he went, up, up, up, until he plunged into the cold misty bosom of a cloud, at which, only a little while before, Bellerophon had been gazing, and fancying it a very pleasant spot. Then again, out of the heart of the cloud, Pegasus shot down like a thunderbolt, as if he meant to dash both himself and his rider headlong against a rock. Then he went through about a thousand of the wildest caprioles that had ever been performed either by a bird or a horse.\n\nI cannot tell you half that he did. He skimmed straight forward, and sidewise, and backward. He reared himself erect, with his fore legs on a wreath of mist, and his hind legs on nothing at all. He flung out his heels behind, and put down his head between his legs, with his wings pointing right upward. At about two miles’ height above the earth, he turned a somerset, so that Bellerophon’s heels were where his head should have been, and he seemed to look down into the sky instead of up. He twisted his head about, and, looking Bellerophon in the face, with fire flashing from his eyes, made a terrible attempt to bite him. He fluttered his pinions so wildly that one of the silver feathers was shaken out, and floating earthward, was picked up by the child, who kept it as long as he lived, in memory of Pegasus and Bellerophon.\n\nBut the latter (who, as you may judge, was as good a horseman as ever galloped) had been watching his opportunity, and at last clapped the golden bit of the enchanted bridle between the winged steed’s jaws. No sooner was this done, than Pegasus became as manageable as if he had taken food, all his life, out of Bellerophon’s hand. To speak what I really feel, it was almost a sadness to see so wild a creature grow suddenly so tame. And Pegasus seemed to feel it so, likewise. He looked round to Bellerophon, with the tears in his beautiful eyes, instead of the fire that so recently flashed from them. But when Bellerophon patted his head, and spoke a few authoritative, yet kind and soothing words, another look came into the eyes of Pegasus; for he was glad at heart, after so many lonely centuries, to have found a companion and a master.\n\nThus it always is with winged horses, and with all such wild and solitary creatures. If you can catch and overcome them, it is the surest way to win their love.\n\nWhile Pegasus had been doing his utmost to shake Bellerophon off his back, he had flown a very long distance; and they had come within sight of a lofty mountain by the time the bit was in his mouth. Bellerophon had seen this mountain before, and knew it to be Helicon, on the summit of which was the winged horse’s abode. Thither (after looking gently into the rider’s face, as if to ask leave) Pegasus now flew, and, alighting, waited patiently until Bellerophon should please to dismount. The young man, accordingly, leaped from his steed’s back, but still held him fast by the bridle. Meeting his eyes, however, he was so affected by the gentleness of his aspect, and by the thought of the free life which Pegasus had heretofore lived, that he could not bear to keep him a prisoner, if he really desired his liberty.\n\nObeying this generous impulse he slipped the enchanted bridle off the head of Pegasus, and took the bit from his mouth.\n\n“Leave me, Pegasus!” said he. “Either leave me, or love me.”\n\nIn an instant the winged horse shot almost out of sight, soaring straight upward from the summit of Mount Helicon. Being long after sunset, it was now twilight on the mountain-top, and dusky evening over all the country round about. But Pegasus flew so high that he overtook the departed day, and was bathed in the upper radiance of the sun. Ascending higher and higher, he looked a bright speck, and, at last, could no longer be seen in the hollow waste of the sky. And Bellerophon was afraid that he should never behold him more. But, while he was lamenting his own folly, the bright speck reappeared, and drew nearer and nearer, until it descended lower than the sunshine; and, behold, Pegasus had come back! After this trial there was no more fear of the winged horse’s making his escape. He and Bellerophon were friends, and put loving faith in one another.\n\nThat night they lay down and slept together, with Bellerophon’s arm about the neck of Pegasus, not as a caution, but for kindness. And they awoke at peep of day, and bade one another good morning, each in his own language.\n\nIn this manner, Bellerophon and the wondrous steed spent several days, and grew better acquainted and fonder of each other all the time. They went on long aërial journeys, and sometimes ascended so high that the earth looked hardly bigger than—the moon. They visited distant countries, and amazed the inhabitants, who thought that the beautiful young man, on the back of the winged horse, must have come down out of the sky. A thousand miles a day was no more than an easy space for the fleet Pegasus to pass over. Bellerophon was delighted with this kind of life, and would have liked nothing better than to live always in the same way, aloft in the clear atmosphere; for it was always sunny weather up there, however cheerless and rainy it might be in the lower region. But he could not forget the horrible Chimæra, which he had promised King Iobates to slay. So, at last, when he had become well accustomed to feats of horsemanship in the air, and could manage Pegasus with the least motion of his hand, and had taught him to obey his voice, he determined to attempt the performance of this perilous adventure.\n\nAt daybreak, therefore, as soon as he unclosed his eyes, he gently pinched the winged horse’s ear, in order to arouse him. Pegasus immediately started from the ground, and pranced about a quarter of a mile aloft, and made a grand sweep around the mountain-top, by way of showing that he was wide awake, and ready for any kind of an excursion. During the whole of this little flight, he uttered a loud, brisk, and melodious neigh, and finally came down at Bellerophon’s side, as lightly as ever you saw a sparrow hop upon a twig.\n\n“Well done, dear Pegasus! well done, my sky-skimmer!” cried Bellerophon, fondly stroking the horse’s neck. “And now, my fleet and beautiful friend, we must break our fast. To-day we are to fight the terrible Chimæra.”\n\nAs soon as they had eaten their morning meal, and drank some sparkling water from a spring called Hippocrene, Pegasus held out his head, of his own accord, so that his master might put on the bridle. Then with a great many playful leaps and airy caperings, he showed his impatience to be gone; while Bellerophon was girding on his sword, and hanging his shield about his neck, and preparing himself for battle. When everything was ready, the rider mounted, and (as was his custom, when going a long distance) ascended five miles perpendicularly, so as the better to see whither he was directing his course. He then turned the head of Pegasus toward the east, and set out for Lycia. In their flight they overtook an eagle, and came so nigh him, before he could get out of their way, that Bellerophon might easily have caught him by the leg. Hastening onward at this rate, it was still early in the forenoon when they beheld the lofty mountains of Lycia, with their deep and shaggy valleys. If Bellerophon had been told truly, it was in one of those dismal valleys that the hideous Chimæra had taken up its abode.\n\nBeing now so near their journey’s end, the winged horse gradually descended with his rider; and they took advantage of some clouds that were floating over the mountain-tops, in order to conceal themselves. Hovering on the upper surface of a cloud, and peeping over its edge, Bellerophon had a pretty distinct view of the mountainous part of Lycia, and could look into all its shadowy vales at once. At first there appeared to be nothing remarkable. It was a wild, savage, and rocky tract of high and precipitous hills. In the more level part of the country, there were the ruins of houses that had been burned, and, here and there, the carcasses of dead cattle, strewn about the pastures where they had been feeding.\n\n“The Chimæra must have done this mischief,” thought Bellerophon. “But where can the monster be?”\n\nAs I have already said, there was nothing remarkable to be detected, at first sight, in any of the valleys and dells that lay among the precipitous heights of the mountains. Nothing at all; unless, indeed, it were three spires of black smoke, which issued from what seemed to be the mouth of a cavern, and clambered sullenly into the atmosphere. Before reaching the mountain-top, these three black smoke-wreaths mingled themselves into one. The cavern was almost directly beneath the winged horse and his rider, at the distance of about a thousand feet. The smoke, as it crept heavily upward, had an ugly, sulphurous, stifling scent, which caused Pegasus to snort and Bellerophon to sneeze. So disagreeable was it to the marvellous steed (who was accustomed to breathe only the purest air), that he waved his wings, and shot half a mile out of the range of this offensive vapor.\n\nBut, on looking behind him, Bellerophon saw something that induced him first to draw the bridle, and then to turn Pegasus about. He made a sign, which the winged horse understood, and sunk slowly through the air, until his hoofs were scarcely more than a man’s height above the rocky bottom of the valley. In front, as far off as you could throw a stone, was the cavern’s mouth, with the three smoke-wreaths oozing out of it. And what else did Bellerophon behold there?\n\nThere seemed to be a heap of strange and terrible creatures curled up within the cavern. Their bodies lay so close together, that Bellerophon could not distinguish them apart; but, judging by their heads, one of these creatures was a huge snake, the second a fierce lion, and the third an ugly goat. The lion and the goat were asleep; the snake was broad awake, and kept staring around him with a great pair of fiery eyes. But—and this was the most wonderful part of the matter—the three spires of smoke evidently issued from the nostrils of these three heads! So strange was the spectacle, that, though Bellerophon had been all along expecting it, the truth did not immediately occur to him, that here was the terrible three-headed Chimæra. He had found out the Chimæra’s cavern. The snake, the lion, and the goat, as he supposed them to be, were not three separate creatures, but one monster!\n\nThe wicked, hateful thing! Slumbering as two-thirds of it were, it still held, in its abominable claws, the remnant of an unfortunate lamb—or possibly (but I hate to think so) it was a dear little boy—which its three mouths had been gnawing, before two of them fell asleep!\n\nAll at once, Bellerophon started as from a dream, and knew it to be the Chimæra. Pegasus seemed to know it, at the same instant, and sent forth a neigh, that sounded like the call of a trumpet to battle. At this sound the three heads reared themselves erect, and belched out great flashes of flame. Before Bellerophon had time to consider what to do next, the monster flung itself out of the cavern and sprang straight toward him, with its immense claws extended, and its snaky tail twisting itself venomously behind. If Pegasus had not been as nimble as a bird, both he and his rider would have been overthrown by the Chimæra’s headlong rush, and thus the battle have been ended before it was well begun. But the winged horse was not to be caught so. In the twinkling of an eye he was up and aloft, half-way to the clouds, snorting with anger. He shuddered, too, not with affright, but with utter disgust at the loathsomeness of this poisonous thing with three heads.\n\nThe Chimæra, on the other hand, raised itself up so as to stand absolutely on the tip-end of its tail, with its talons pawing fiercely in the air, and its three heads spluttering fire at Pegasus and his rider. My stars, how it roared, and hissed and bellowed! Bellerophon, meanwhile, was fitting his shield on his arm, and drawing his sword.\n\n“Now, my beloved Pegasus,” he whispered in the winged horse’s ear, “thou must help me to slay this insufferable monster; or else thou shalt fly back to thy solitary mountain-peak without thy friend Bellerophon. For either the Chimæra dies, or its three mouths shall gnaw this head of mine, which has slumbered upon thy neck!”\n\nPegasus whinnied, and, turning back his head, rubbed his nose tenderly against his rider’s cheek. It was his way of telling him that, though he had wings and was an immortal horse, yet he would perish, if it were possible for immortality to perish, rather than leave Bellerophon behind.\n\n“I thank you, Pegasus,” answered Bellerophon. “Now, then, let us make a dash at the monster!”\n\nUttering these words, he shook the bridle; and Pegasus darted down aslant, as swift as the flight of an arrow, right toward the Chimæra’s threefold head, which, all this time, was poking itself as high as it could into the air. As he came within arm’s-length, Bellerophon made a cut at the monster, but was carried onward by his steed, before he could see whether the blow had been successful. Pegasus continued his course, but soon wheeled round, at about the same distance from the Chimæra as before. Bellerophon then perceived that he had cut the goat’s head of the monster almost off, so that it dangled downward by the skin, and seemed quite dead.\n\nBut, to make amends, the snake’s head and the lion’s head had taken all the fierceness of the dead one into themselves, and spit flame, and hissed, and roared, with a vast deal more fury than before.\n\n“Never mind, my brave Pegasus!” cried Bellerophon. “With another stroke like that, we will stop either its hissing or its roaring.”\n\nAnd again he shook the bridle. Dashing aslantwise, as before, the winged horse made another arrow-flight toward the Chimæra, and Bellerophon aimed another downright stroke at one of the two remaining heads, as he shot by. But this time, neither he nor Pegasus escaped so well as at first. With one of its claws, the Chimæra had given the young man a deep scratch in his shoulder, and had slightly damaged the left wing of the flying steed with the other. On his part, Bellerophon had mortally wounded the lion’s head of the monster, insomuch that it now hung downward, with its fire almost extinguished, and sending out gasps of thick black smoke. The snake’s head, however (which was the only one now left), was twice as fierce and venomous as ever before. It belched forth shoots of fire five hundred yards long, and emitted hisses so loud, so harsh, and so ear-piercing, that King Iobates heard them, fifty miles off, and trembled till the throne shook under him.\n\n“Well-a-day!” thought the poor king; “the Chimæra is certainly coming to devour me!”\n\nMeanwhile Pegasus had again paused in the air, and neighed angrily, while sparkles of a pure crystal flame darted out of his eyes. How unlike the lurid fire of the Chimæra! The aërial steed’s spirit was all aroused, and so was that of Bellerophon.\n\n“Dost thou bleed, my immortal horse?” cried the young man, caring less for his own hurt than for the anguish of this glorious creature, that ought never to have tasted pain. “The execrable Chimæra shall pay for this mischief with his last head!”\n\nThen he shook the bridle, shouted loudly, and guided Pegasus, not aslantwise as before, but straight at the monster’s hideous front. So rapid was the onset, that it seemed but a dazzle and a flash before Bellerophon was at close gripes with his enemy.\n\nThe Chimæra, by this time, after losing its second head, had got into a red-hot passion of pain and rampant rage. It so flounced about, half on earth and partly in the air, that it was impossible to say which element it rested upon. It opened its snake-jaws to such an abominable width, that Pegasus might almost, I was going to say, have flown right down its throat, wings outspread, rider and all! At their approach it shot out a tremendous blast of its fiery breath, and enveloped Bellerophon and his steed in a perfect atmosphere of flame, singeing the wings of Pegasus, scorching off one whole side of the young man’s golden ringlets, and making them both far hotter than was comfortable, from head to foot.\n\nBut this was nothing to what followed.\n\nWhen the airy rush of the winged horse had brought him within the distance of one hundred yards, the Chimæra gave a spring, and flung its huge, awkward, venomous, and utterly detestable carcass right upon poor Pegasus, clung around him with might and main, and tied up its snaky tail into a knot! Up flew the aërial steed, higher, higher, higher, above the mountain-peaks, above the clouds, and almost out of sight of the solid earth. But still the earth-born monster kept its hold, and was borne upward, along with the creature of light and air. Bellerophon, meanwhile, turning about, found himself face to face with the ugly grimness of the Chimæra’s visage, and could only avoid being scorched to death, or bitten right in twain, by holding up his shield. Over the upper edge of the shield, he looked sternly into the savage eyes of the monster.\n\nBut the Chimæra was so mad and wild with pain, that it did not guard itself so well as might else have been the case. Perhaps, after all, the best way to fight a Chimæra is by getting as close to it as you can. In its efforts to stick its horrible iron claws into its enemy, the creature left its own breast quite exposed; and perceiving this, Bellerophon thrust his sword up to the hilt into its cruel heart. Immediately the snaky tail untied its knot. The monster let go its hold of Pegasus, and fell from that vast height downward; while the fire within its bosom, instead of being put out, burned fiercer than ever, and quickly began to consume the dead carcass. Thus it fell out of the sky, all aflame, and (it being nightfall before it reached the earth) was mistaken for a shooting star or a comet. But, at early sunrise, some cottagers were going to their day’s labor, and saw, to their astonishment, that several acres of ground were strewn with black ashes. In the middle of a field, there was a heap of whitened bones, a great deal higher than a haystack. Nothing else was ever seen of the dreadful Chimæra!\n\nAnd when Bellerophon had won the victory, he bent forward and kissed Pegasus, while the tears stood in his eyes.\n\n“Back now, my beloved steed!” said he. “Back to the Fountain of Pirene!”\n\nPegasus skimmed through the air, quicker than ever he did before, and reached the fountain in a very short time. And there he found the old man leaning on his staff, and the country fellow watering his cow, and the pretty maiden filling her pitcher.\n\n“I remember now,” quoth the old man, “I saw this winged horse once before, when I was quite a lad. But he was ten times handsomer in those days.”\n\n“I own a cart-horse, worth three of him!” said the country fellow. “If this pony were mine, the first thing I should do would be to clip his wings!”\n\nBut the poor maiden said nothing, for she had always the luck to be afraid at the wrong time. So she ran away, and let her pitcher tumble down, and broke it.\n\n“Where is the gentle child,” asked Bellerophon, “who used to keep me company, and never lost his faith, and never was weary of gazing into the fountain?”\n\n“Here am I, dear Bellerophon!” said the child, softly.\n\nFor the little boy had spent day after day, on the margin of Pirene, waiting for his friend to come back; but when he perceived Bellerophon descending through the clouds, mounted on the winged horse, he had shrunk back into the shrubbery. He was a delicate and tender child, and dreaded lest the old man and the country fellow should see the tears gushing from his eyes.\n\n“Thou hast won the victory,” said he, joyfully, running to the knee of Bellerophon, who still sat on the back of Pegasus. “I knew thou wouldst.”\n\n“Yes, dear child!” replied Bellerophon, alighting from the winged horse. “But if thy faith had not helped me, I should never have waited for Pegasus, and never have gone up above the clouds, and never have conquered the terrible Chimæra. Thou, my beloved little friend, hast done it all. And now let us give Pegasus his liberty.”\n\nSo he slipped off the enchanted bridle from the head of the marvellous steed.\n\n“Be free, for evermore, my Pegasus!” cried he, with a shade of sadness in his tone. “Be as free as thou art fleet!”\n\nBut Pegasus rested his head on Bellerophon’s shoulder, and would not be persuaded to take flight.\n\n“Well then,” said Bellerophon, caressing the airy horse, “thou shalt be with me, as long as thou wilt; and we will go together, forthwith, and tell King Iobates that the Chimæra is destroyed.”\n\nThen Bellerophon embraced the gentle child, and promised to come to him again, and departed. But, in after years, that child took higher flights upon the aërial steed than ever did Bellerophon, and achieved more honorable deeds than his friend’s victory over the Chimæra. For, gentle and tender as he was, he grew to be a mighty poet!",

    "content": "I\n\n'That was a remarkably fine dinner yesterday,' observed an old Mouse of the female sex to another who had not been at the festive gathering. 'I sat number twenty-one from the old Mouse King, so that I was not badly placed. Should you like to hear the order of the banquet? The courses were very well arranged—mouldy bread, bacon rind, tallow candle, and sausage—and then the same dishes over again from the beginning: it was just as good as having two banquets on end. There was as much joviality and agreeable jesting as in the family circle. Nothing was left but the pegs at the ends of the sausages. And the discourse turned upon these; and at last the expression, \"Soup on a sausage-peg,\" was mentioned. Every one had heard the proverb, but no one had ever tasted the sausage-peg soup, much less knew how to prepare it. A capital toast was drunk to the inventor of the soup, and it was said he deserved to be a relieving officer. Was not that witty? And the old Mouse King stood up, and promised that the young mouse who could best prepare that soup should be his queen; and a year was allowed for the trial.'\n\n'That was not at all bad,' said the other Mouse; 'but how does one prepare this soup?'\n\n'Ah, how is it prepared? That is just what all the young female mice, and the old ones too, are asking. They would all very much like to be queen; but they don't want to take the trouble to go out into the world to learn how to prepare the soup, and that they would certainly have to do. But every one has not the gift of leaving the family circle and the chimney corner. Away from home one can't get cheese rinds and bacon every day. No, one must bear hunger, and perhaps be eaten up alive by a cat.'\n\nSuch were no doubt the thoughts by which most of them were scared from going out to gain information. Only four Mice announced themselves ready to depart. They were young and brisk, but poor. Each of them would go to one of the four quarters of the globe, and then it was a question which of them was favoured by fortune. Every one took a sausage-peg, so as to keep in mind the object of the journey. This was to be their pilgrim's staff.\n\nIt was at the beginning of May that they set cut, and they did not return till the May of the following year; and then only three of them appeared. The fourth did not report herself, nor was there any intelligence of her, though the day of trial was close at hand.\n\n'Yes, there's always some drawback in even the pleasantest affair,' said the Mouse King.\n\nAnd then he gave orders that all mice within a circuit of many miles should be invited. They were to assemble in the kitchen, the three travelled Mice stood in a row by themselves, while a sausage-peg, shrouded in crape, was set up as a memento of the fourth, who was missing. No one was to proclaim his opinion before the three had spoken and the Mouse King had settled what was to be said further. And now let us hear.\n\nII\n\nWhat the First little Mouse had seen and learned in her Travels\n\n'When I went out into the wide world,' said the little Mouse, 'I thought, as many think at my age, that I had already learned everything; but that was not the case. Years must pass before one gets so far. I went to sea at once. I went in a ship that steered towards the north. They had told me that the ship's cook must know how to manage things at sea ; but it is easy enough to manage things when one has plenty of sides of bacon, and whole tubs of salt pork, and mouldy flour. One has delicate living on board ; but one does not learn to prepare soup on a sausage-peg. We sailed along for many days and nights ; the ship rocked fearfully, and we did not get off without a wetting. When we at last reached the port to which we were bound, I left the ship ; and it was high up in the far north.\n\n'It is a wonderful thing, to go out of one's own corner at home, and sail in a ship, where one has a sort of corner too, and then suddenly to find oneself hundreds of miles away in a strange land. I saw great pathless forests of pine and birch, which smelt so strong that I sneezed, and thought of sausage. There were great lakes there too. When I came close to them the waters were quite clear, but from a distance they looked black as ink. White swans floated upon them : I thought at first they were spots of foam, they lay so still ; but then I saw them walk and fly, and I recognized them. They belong to the goose family — one can see that by their walk ; for no one can deny his parentage. I kept with my own kind. I associated with the forest and field mice, who, by the way, know very little, especially as regards cookery, though this was the very thing that had brought me abroad. The thought that soup might be boiled on a sausage-peg was such a startling idea to them, that it flew at once from mouth to mouth through the whole forest. They declared the problem could never be solved ; and little did I think that there, on the very first night, I should be initiated into the method of its preparation. It was in the height of summer, and that, the mice said, was the reason why the wood smelt so strongly, and why the herbs were so fragrant, and the lakes so clear and yet so dark, with the white swans on them.\n\n'On the margin of the wood, among three or four houses, a pole as tall as the mainmast of a ship had been erected, and from its summit hung wreaths and ribbons : this was called a maypole. Men and maids danced round the tree, and sang as loudly as they could, to the violin of the fiddler. There were merry doings at sundown and in the moonlight, but I took no part in them—what has a little mouse to do with a May dance? I sat in the soft moss and held my sausage-peg fast. The moon shone especially upon one spot, where a tree stood, covered with moss so fine that I may almost venture to say it was as fine as the skin of the Mouse King; but it was of a green colour, so that it was a great relief to the eye.\n\n'All at once, the most charming little people came marching forth. They were only tall enough to reach to my knee. They looked like men, but were better proportioned: they called themselves elves, and had delicate clothes on, of flower leaves trimmed with the wings of flies and gnats, which had a very good appearance. Directly they appeared, they seemed to be seeking for something—I knew not what; but at last some of them came towards me, and the chief pointed to my sausage-peg, and said, \"That is just such a one as we want—it is pointed—it is capital!\" and the longer he looked at my pilgrim's staff the more delighted he became.\n\n'\"I will lend it,\" I said, \"but not to keep.\"\n\n'\"Not to keep!\" they all repeated; and they seized the sausage-peg, which I gave up to them, and danced away to the spot where the fine moss grew; and here they set up the peg in the midst of the green. They wanted to have a maypole of their own, and the one they now had, seemed cut out for them; and they decorated it so that it was beautiful to behold.\n\n'First, little spiders spun it round with gold thread, and hung it all over with fluttering veils and flags, so finely woven, bleached so snowy white in the moonshine, that they dazzled my eyes. They took colours from the butterfly's wing, and strewed these over the white linen, and flowers and diamonds gleamed upon it, so that I did not know my sausage-peg again: there is not in all the world such a maypole as they had made of it. And now came the real great party of elves. They were quite without clothes, and looked as dainty as possible; and they invited me to be present; but I was to keep at a distance, for I was too large for them.\n\n'And now began such music! It sounded like thousands of glass bells, so full, so rich, that I thought the swans were singing. I fancied also that I heard the voice of the cuckoo and the blackbird, and at last the whole forest seemed to join in. I heard children's voices, the sound of bells, and the song of birds; the most glorious melodies—and all came from the elves' maypole, namely, my sausage-peg. I should never have believed that so much could come out of it; but that depends very much upon the hands into which it falls. I was quite touched. I wept, as a little mouse may weep, with pure pleasure.\n\n'The night was far too short; but it is not longer up yonder at that season. In the morning dawn the breeze began to blow, the mirror of the forest lake was covered with ripples, and all the delicate veils and flags fluttered away in the air. The waving garlands of spiders' web, the hanging bridges and balustrades, and whatever else they are called, flew away as if they were nothing at all. Six elves brought me back my sausage-peg, and asked me at the same time if I had any wish that they could gratify; so I asked them if they could tell me how soup was made on a sausage-peg.\n\n'\"How we do it? \" asked the chief of the elves, with a smile. \" Why, you have just seen it. I fancy you hardly knew your sausage-peg again?\"\n\n'\"You only mean that as a joke,\" I replied. And then I told them in so many words, why I had undertaken a journey, and what hopes were founded on it at home. \"What advantage,\" I asked, \"can it be to our Mouse King, and to our whole powerful state, from the fact of my having witnessed all this festivity? I cannot shake it out of the sausage-peg, and say, 'Look, here is the peg, now the soup will come.' That would be a dish that could only be put on the table when the guests had dined.\"\n\n'Then the elf dipped his little finger into the cup of a blue violet, and said to me,\n\n'\"See here! I will anoint your pilgrim's staff; and when you go back home to the castle of the Mouse King, you have but to touch his warm breast with the staff, and violets will spring forth and cover its whole staff, even in the coldest winter-time. And so I think I've given you something to carry home, and a little more than something!\"'\n\nBut before the little Mouse said what this 'something more' was, she stretched her staff out towards the King's breast, and in very truth the most beautiful bunch of violets burst forth; and the scent was so powerful that the Mouse King incontinently ordered the mice who stood nearest the chimney to thrust their tails into the fire and create a smell of burning, for the odour of the violets was not to be borne, and was not of the kind he liked.\n\n'But what was the \"something more\", of which you spoke?' asked the Mouse King.\n\n'Why,' the little Mouse answered, 'I think it is what they call effect!' and herewith she turned the staff round, and lo! there was not a single flower to be seen upon it; she only held the naked skewer, and lifted this up like a music baton. '\"Violets,\" the elf said to me, \"are for sight, and smell, and touch. Therefore it yet remains to provide for hearing and taste!\"'\n\nAnd now the little Mouse began to beat time; and music was heard, not such as sounded in the forest among the elves, but such as is heard in the kitchen. There was a bubbling sound of boiling and roasting; and all at once it seemed as if the sound were rushing through every chimney, and pots or kettles were boiling over. The fire-shovel hammered upon the brass kettle, and then, on a sudden, all was quiet again. They heard the quiet subdued song of the tea-kettle, and it was wonderful to hear—they could not quite tell if the kettle were beginning to sing or leaving off; and the little pot simmered, and the big pot simmered, and neither cared for the other: there seemed to be no reason at all in the pots. And the little Mouse flourished her baton more and more wildly; the pots foamed, threw up large bubbles, boiled over, and the wind roared and whistled through the chimney. Oh! it became so terrible that the little Mouse lost her stick at last.\n\n'That was a heavy soup!' said the Mouse King. 'Shall we not soon hear about the preparation?'\n\n'That was all,' said the little Mouse, with a bow.\n\n'That all! Then we should be glad to hear what the next has to relate,' said the Mouse King.\n\nIII\n\nWhat the Second little Mouse had to tell\n\n'I was born in the palace library,' said the second Mouse. 'I and several members of our family never knew the happiness of getting into the dining-room, much less into the store-room; on my journey, and here to-day, are the only times I have seen a kitchen. We have indeed often been compelled to suffer hunger in the library, but we got a good deal of knowledge. The rumour penetrated even to us, of the royal prize offered to those who could cook soup upon a sausage-peg; and it was my old grandmother who thereupon ferreted out a manuscript, which she certainly could not read, but which she had heard read out, and in which it was written: \"Those who are poets can boil soup upon a sausage-peg.\" She asked me if I were a poet. I felt quite innocent of that, and then she told me I must go out, and manage to become one. I again asked what was required for that, for it was as difficult for me to find that out as to prepare the soup; but grandmother had heard a good deal of reading, and she said that three things were especially necessary: \"Understanding, imagination, feeling—if you can go and get these into you, you are a poet, and the sausage-peg affair will be quite easy to you.\"\n\n'And I went forth, and marched towards the west, away into the wide world, to become a poet.\n\n'Understanding is the most important thing in every affair. I knew that, for the two other things are not held in half such respect, and consequently I went out first to seek understanding. Yes, where does that dwell? \"Go to the ant and be wise,\" said the great King of the Jews; I knew that from the library; and I never stopped till I came to the first great ant-hill, and there I placed myself on the watch, to become wise.\n\n'The ants are a respectable people. They are understanding itself. Everything with them is like a well-worked sum, that comes right. To work and to lay eggs, they say, is to live while you live, and to provide for posterity; and accordingly that is what they do. They were divided into the clean and the dirty ants. The rank of each is indicated by a number, and the ant queen is number one; and her view is the only correct one, she has absorbed all wisdom; and that was important for me to know. She spoke so much, and it was all so clever, that it sounded to me like nonsense. She declared her ant-hill was the loftiest thing in the world; though close by it grew a tree, which was certainly loftier, much loftier, that could not be denied, and therefore it was never mentioned. One evening an ant had lost herself upon the tree; she had crept up the stem—not up to the crown, but higher than any ant had climbed until then; and when she turned, and came back home, she talked of something far higher than the ant-hill that she had found; but the other ants considered that an insult to the whole community, and consequently she was condemned to wear a muzzle, and to continual solitary confinement. But a short time afterwards another ant got on the tree, and made the same journey and the same discovery: and this one spoke about it with caution and indefiniteness, as they said; and as, moreover, she was one of the pure ants and very much respected, they believed her; and when she died they erected an egg-shell as a memorial of her, for they had a great respect for the sciences. I saw,' continued the little Mouse, 'that the ants are always running to and fro with their eggs on their backs. One of them once dropped her egg; she exerted herself greatly to pick it up again, but she could not succeed. Then two others came up, and helped her with all their might, insomuch that they nearly dropped their own eggs over it; but then they stopped helping at once, for each should think of himself first—the ant queen had declared that by so doing they exhibited at once heart and understanding.\n\n'\"These two qualities,\" she said, \"place us ants on the highest step among all reasoning beings. Understanding must and shall be the predominant thing, and I have the greatest share of understanding.\" And so saying, she raised herself on her hind legs, so that she was easily to be recognized. I could not be mistaken, and I ate her up. Go to the ant and be wise—and I had got the queen!\n\n'I now proceeded nearer to the before-mentioned lofty tree. It was an oak, and had a great trunk and a far-spreading top, and was very old. I knew that a living being dwelt here, a Dryad as it is called, who is born with the tree, and dies with it. I had heard about this in the library; and now I saw an oak tree and an oak girl. She uttered a piercing cry when she saw me so near. Like all females, she was very much afraid of mice; and she had more ground for fear than others, for I might have gnawed through the stem of the tree on which her life depended. I spoke to her in a friendly and intimate way, and bade her take courage. And she took me up in her delicate hand; and when I had told her my reason for coming out into the wide world, she promised me that perhaps on that very evening I should have one of the two treasures of which I was still in quest. She told me that Phantasy was her very good friend, that he was beautiful as the god of love, and that he rested many an hour under the leafy boughs of the tree, which then rustled more strongly than ever over the pair of them. He called her his Dryad, she said, and the tree his tree, for the grand gnarled oak was just to his taste, with its root burrowing so deep in the earth and the stem and crown rising so high out in the fresh air, and knowing the beating snow, and the sharp wind, and the warm sunshine, as they deserve to be known. \"Yes,\" the Dryad continued, \"the birds sing aloft there and tell of strange countries; and on the only dead bough the stork has built a nest which is highly ornamental, and, moreover, one gets to hear something of the land of the pyramids. All that is very pleasing to Phantasy; but it is not enough for him: I myself must tell him of life in the woods, when I was little, and the tree such a delicate thing that a stinging-nettle overshadowed it—and I have to tell everything, till now that the tree is great and strong. Sit you down under the green woodruff, and pay attention; and when Phantasy comes, I shall find an opportunity to pinch his wings, and to pull out a little feather. Take that—no better is given to any poet—and it will be enough for you!\"\n\n'And when Phantasy came the feather was plucked, and I seized it,' said the little Mouse. 'I held it in water, till it grew soft. It was very hard to digest, but I nibbled it up at last. It is not at all easy to gnaw oneself into being a poet, there are so many things one must take into oneself. Now I had these two things, imagination and understanding, and through these I knew that the third was to be found in the library; for a great man has said and written that there are romances whose sole and single use is that they relieve people of their superfluous tears, and that they are, in fact, like sponges sucking up human emotion. I remembered a few of these old books, which had always looked especially palatable, and were much thumbed and very greasy, having evidently absorbed a great deal of feeling into themselves.\n\n'I betook myself back to the library, and devoured nearly a whole novel—that is, the essence of it, the soft part, for I left the crust or binding. When I had digested this, and a second one in addition, I felt a stirring within me, and I ate a bit of a third romance, and now I was a poet. I said so to myself, and told the others also. I had headache, and stomach-ache, and I can't tell what aches besides. I began thinking what kind of stories could be made to refer to a sausage-peg; and many pegs came into my mind—the ant queen must have had a particularly fine understanding. I remembered the man who took a white peg in his mouth, and then both he and the peg were invisible. I thought of being screwed up a peg, of standing on one's own pegs, and of driving a peg into one's own coffin. All my thoughts ran upon pegs; and when one is a poet (and I am a poet, for I have worked most terribly hard to become one) a person can make poetry on these subjects. I shall therefore be able to wait upon you every day with a poem or a history—and that's the soup I have to offer.'\n\n'Let us hear what the third has to say,' said the Mouse King.\n\n'Peep! peep!' was heard at the kitchen door, and a little Mouse—it was the fourth of them, the one whom they looked upon as dead—shot in like an arrow. She toppled the sausage-peg with the crape covering over. She had been running day and night, and had travelled on the railway, in the goods train, having watched her opportunity, and yet she had almost come too late. She pressed forward, looking very much rumpled, and she had lost her sausage-peg, but not her voice, for she at once took up the word, as if they had been waiting only for her, and wanted to hear none but her, and as if everything else in the world were of no consequence. She spoke at once, and spoke fully: she had appeared so suddenly that no one found time to object to her speech or to her, while she was speaking. And now let us hear her.\n\nIV\n\nWhat the Fourth Mouse, who spoke before the Third had spoken, had to tell\n\nI went immediately to the largest town,' she said; 'the name has escaped me—I have a bad memory for names. From the railway I was carried, with some confiscated goods, to the council-house, and there I ran into the dwelling of the jailer. The jailer was talking of his prisoners, and especially of one, who had spoken unconsidered words. These words had given rise to others, and these latter had been written down and recorded.\n\n'\"The whole thing is soup on a sausage-peg,\" said the jailer; \"but the soup may cost him his neck.\"\n\n'Now, this gave me an interest in the prisoner,' continued the Mouse, 'and I watched my opportunity and slipped into his prison—for there's a mouse-hole to be found behind every locked door. The prisoner looked pale, and had a great beard and bright sparkling eyes. The lamp smoked, but the walls were so accustomed to that, that they grew none the blacker for it. The prisoner scratched pictures and verses in white upon the black ground, but I did not read them. I think he found it tedious, and I was a welcome guest. He lured me with bread crumbs, with whistling, and with friendly words: he was glad to see me, and I got to trust him, and we became friends. He shared with me his bread and water, gave me cheese and sausage; I lived well, but I must say that it was especially the good society that kept me there. He let me run upon his hand, his arm, and into his sleeve; he let me creep about in his beard, and called me his little friend. I really got to love him, for these things are reciprocal. I forgot my mission in the wide world, forgot my sausage-peg in a crack in the floor—it's lying there still. I wished to stay where I was, for if I went away the poor prisoner would have no one at all, and that's having too little, in this world. I stayed, but he did not stay. He spoke to me very mournfully the last time, gave me twice as much bread and cheese as usual, and kissed his hand to me; then he went away, and never came back. I don't know his history.\n\n'\"Soup on a sausage-peg!\" said the jailer, to whom I now went; but I should not have trusted him. He took me in his hand, certainly, but he popped me into a cage, a treadmill. That's a horrible engine, in which you go round and round without getting any farther; and people laugh at you into the bargain.\n\n'The jailer's granddaughter was a charming little thing, with a mass of curly hair that shone like gold, and such merry eyes, and such a smiling mouth!\n\n'\"You poor little mouse,\" she said, as she peeped into my ugly cage; and she drew out the iron rod, and forth I jumped to the window board, and from thence to the roof spout. Free! free! I thought only of that, and not of the goal of my journey.\n\n'It was dark, and night was coming on. I took up my quarters in an old tower, where dwelt a watchman and an owl. I trusted neither of them, and the owl least. That is a creature like a cat, who has the great failing that she eats mice. But one may be mistaken, and so was I, for this was a very respectable, well-educated old owl: she knew more than the watchman, and as much as I. The young owls were always making a racket; but \"Do not make soup on a sausage-peg\" were the hardest words she could prevail on herself to utter, she was so fondly attached to her family. Her conduct inspired me with so much confidence, that from the crack in which I was crouching I called out \"Peep!\" to her. This confidence of mine pleased her hugely, and she assured me I should be under her protection, and that no creature should be allowed to do me wrong; she would reserve me for herself, for the winter, when there would be short commons.\n\n'She was in every respect a clever woman, and explained to me how the watchman could only \"whoop\" with the horn that hung at his side, adding, \"He is terribly conceited about it, and imagines he's an owl in the tower. Wants to do great things, but is very small—soup on a sausage-peg!\"\n\n'I begged the owl to give me the recipe for this soup, and then she explained the matter to me.\n\n'\"Soup on a sausage-peg,\" she said, \"was only a human proverb, and was understood in different ways: Each thinks his own way the best, but the whole really signifies nothing.\"\n\n'\"Nothing!\" I exclaimed. I was quite struck. Truth is not always agreeable, but truth is above everything; and that's what the old owl said. I now thought about it, and readily perceived that if I brought what was above everything I brought something far beyond soup on a sausage-peg. So I hastened away, that I might get home in time, and bring the highest and best, that is above everything—namely, the truth. The mice are an enlightened people, and the King is above them all. He is capable of making me Queen, for the sake of truth.'\n\n'Your truth is a falsehood,' said the Mouse who had not yet spoken. 'I can prepare the soup, and I mean to prepare it.'\n\nV\n\nHow it was prepared\n\n'I did not travel,' the third Mouse said. 'I remained in my country—that's the right thing to do. There's no necessity for travelling; one can get everything as good here. I stayed at home. I've not learned what I know from supernatural beings, or gobbled it up, or held converse with owls. I have what I know through my own reflections. Will you just put that kettle upon the fire and get water poured in up to the brim! Now make up the fire, that the water may boil—it must boil over and over! Now throw the peg in. Will the King now be pleased to dip his tail in the boiling water, and to stir it round? The longer the King stirs it, the more powerful will the soup become. It costs nothing at all—no further materials are necessary, only stir it round!'\n\n'Cannot any one else do that?' asked the Mouse King.\n\n'No,' replied the Mouse. 'The power is contained only in the tail of the Mouse King.'\n\nAnd the water boiled and bubbled, and the Mouse King stood close beside the kettle—there was almost danger in it—and he put forth his tail, as the mice do in the dairy, when they skim the cream from a pan of milk, and afterwards lick the tail; but he only got his into the hot steam, and then he sprang hastily down from the hearth.\n\n'Of course—certainly you are my Queen,' he said. 'We'll wait for the soup till our golden wedding, so that the poor of my subjects may have something to which they can look forward with pleasure for a long time.'\n\nAnd soon the wedding was held. But many of the mice said, as they were returning home, that it could not be really called soup on a sausage-peg, but rather soup on a mouse's tail. They said that some of the stories had been very cleverly told; but the whole thing might have been different. 'I should have told it so—and so—and so!'\n\nThus said the critics, who are always wise—after the fact.\n\nAnd this story went round the world; and opinions varied concerning it, but the story remained as it was. And that's the best in great things and in small, so also with regard to soup on a sausage-peg—not to expect any thanks for it.",

    "content": "In the old city of Trœzene, at the foot of a lofty mountain, there lived, a very long time ago, a little boy named Theseus. His grandfather, King Pittheus, was the sovereign of that country, and was reckoned a very wise man; so that Theseus, being brought up in the royal palace, and being naturally a bright lad, could hardly fail of profiting by the old king’s instructions. His mother’s name was Æthra. As for his father, the boy had never seen him. But, from his earliest remembrance, Æthra used to go with little Theseus into a wood, and sit down upon a moss-grown rock, which was deeply sunken into the earth. Here she often talked with her son about his father, and said that he was called Ægeus, and that he was a great king, and ruled over Attica, and dwelt at Athens, which was as famous a city as any in the world. Theseus was very fond of hearing about King Ægeus, and often asked his good mother Æthra why he did not come and live with them at Trœzene.\n\n“Ah, my dear son,” answered Æthra, with a sigh, “a monarch has his people to take care of. The men and women over whom he rules are in the place of children to him; and he can seldom spare time to love his own children as other parents do. Your father will never be able to leave his kingdom for the sake of seeing his little boy.”\n\n“Well, but, dear mother,” asked the boy, “why cannot I go to this famous city of Athens, and tell King Ægeus that I am his son?”\n\n“That may happen by-and-by,” said Æthra. “Be patient, and we shall see. You are not yet big and strong enough to set out on such an errand.”\n\n“And how soon shall I be strong enough?” Theseus persisted in inquiring.\n\n“You are but a tiny boy as yet,” replied his mother. “See if you can lift this rock on which we are sitting.”\n\nThe little fellow had a great opinion of his own strength. So, grasping the rough protuberances of the rock, he tugged and toiled amain, and got himself quite out of breath, without being able to stir the heavy stone. It seemed to be rooted into the ground. No wonder he could not move it; for it would have taken all the force of a very strong man to lift it out of its earthy bed.\n\nHis mother stood looking on, with a sad kind of a smile on her lips and in her eyes, to see the zealous and yet puny efforts of her little boy. She could not help being sorrowful at finding him already so impatient to begin his adventures in the world.\n\n“You see how it is, my dear Theseus,” said she, “you must possess far more strength than now before I can trust you to go to Athens, and tell King Ægeus that you are his son. But when you can lift this rock, and show me what is hidden beneath it, I promise you my permission to depart.”\n\nOften and often, after this, did Theseus ask his mother, whether it was yet time for him to go to Athens; and still his mother pointed to the rock, and told him that, for years to come, he could not be strong enough to move it. And again and again the rosy-cheeked and curly-headed boy would tug and strain at the huge mass of stone, striving, child as he was, to do what a giant could hardly have done without taking both of his great hands to the task. Meanwhile the rock seemed to be sinking farther and farther into the ground. The moss grew over it thicker and thicker, until at last it looked almost like a soft green seat, with only a few gray knobs of granite peeping out. The overhanging trees, also, shed their brown leaves upon it, as often as the autumn came; and at its base grew ferns and wild flowers, some of which crept quite over its surface. To all appearance, the rock was as firmly fastened as any other portion of the earth’s substance.\n\nBut, difficult as the matter looked, Theseus was now growing up to be such a vigorous youth, that, in his own opinion, the time would quickly come when he might hope to get the upper hand of this ponderous lump of stone.\n\n“Mother, I do believe it has started!” cried he, after one of his attempts. “The earth around it is certainly a little cracked!”\n\n“No, no, child!” his mother hastily answered. “It is not possible you can have moved it, such a boy as you still are.”\n\nNor would she be convinced, although Theseus showed her the place where he fancied that the stem of a flower had been partly uprooted by the movement of the rock. But Æthra sighed and looked disquieted; for, no doubt, she began to be conscious that her son was no longer a child, and that, in a little while hence, she must send him forth among the perils and troubles of the world.\n\nIt was not more than a year afterwards when they were again sitting on the moss-covered stone. Æthra had once more told him the oft-repeated story of his father, and how gladly he would receive Theseus at his stately palace, and how he would present him to his courtiers and the people, and tell them that here was the heir of his dominions. The eyes of Theseus glowed with enthusiasm, and he would hardly sit still to hear his mother speak.\n\n“Dear mother Æthra,” he exclaimed, “I never felt half so strong as now! I am no longer a child, nor a boy, nor a mere youth! I feel myself a man! It is now time to make one earnest trial to remove the stone.”\n\n“Ah, my dearest Theseus,” replied his mother, “not yet! not yet!”\n\n“Yes, mother,” said he, resolutely, “the time has come!”\n\nThen Theseus bent himself in good earnest to the task, and strained every sinew, with manly strength and resolution. He put his whole brave heart into the effort. He wrestled with the big and sluggish stone, as if it had been a living enemy. He heaved, he lifted, he resolved now to succeed, or else to perish there, and let the rock be his monument for ever! Æthra stood gazing at him, and clasped her hands, partly with a mother’s pride,[19] and partly with a mother’s sorrow. The great rock stirred! Yes, it was raised slowly from the bedded moss and earth, uprooting the shrubs and flowers along with it, and was turned upon its side. Theseus had conquered!\n\nWhile taking breath, he looked joyfully at his mother, and she smiled upon him through her tears.\n\n“Yes, Theseus,” she said, “the time has come, and you must stay no longer at my side! See what King Ægeus, your royal father, left for you, beneath the stone, when he lifted it in his mighty arms, and laid it on the spot whence you have now removed it.”\n\nTheseus looked, and saw that the rock had been placed over another slab of stone, containing a cavity within it; so that it somewhat resembled a roughly-made chest or coffer, of which the upper mass had served as the lid. Within the cavity lay a sword, with a golden hilt, and a pair of sandals.\n\n“That was your father’s sword,” said Æthra, “and those were his sandals. When he went to be King of Athens, he bade me treat you as a child until you should prove yourself a man by lifting this heavy stone. That task being accomplished, you are to put on his sandals, in order to follow in your father’s footsteps, and to gird on his sword, so that you may fight giants and dragons, as King Ægeus did in his youth.”\n\n“I will set out for Athens this very day!” cried Theseus.\n\nBut his mother persuaded him to stay a day or two longer, while she got ready some necessary articles for his journey. When his grandfather,[20] the wise King Pittheus, heard that Theseus intended to present himself at his father’s palace, he earnestly advised him to get on board of a vessel, and go by sea; because he might thus arrive within fifteen miles of Athens, without either fatigue or danger.\n\n“The roads are very bad by land,” quoth the venerable king; “and they are terribly infested with robbers and monsters. A mere lad, like Theseus, is not fit to be trusted on such a perilous journey, all by himself. No, no; let him go by sea!”\n\nBut when Theseus heard of robbers and monsters, he pricked up his ears, and was so much the more eager to take the road along which they were to be met with. On the third day, therefore, he bade a respectful farewell to his grandfather, thanking him for all his kindness, and, after affectionately embracing his mother, he set forth, with a good many of her tears glistening on his cheeks, and some, if the truth must be told, that had gushed out of his own eyes. But he let the sun and wind dry them, and walked stoutly on, playing with the golden hilt of his sword, and taking very manly strides in his father’s sandals.\n\nI cannot stop to tell you hardly any of the adventures that befell Theseus on the road to Athens. It is enough to say, that he quite cleared that part of the country of the robbers, about whom King Pittheus had been so much alarmed. One of these bad people was named Procrustes; and he was indeed a terrible fellow, and had an ugly way of making fun of the poor travellers who happened[21] to fall into his clutches. In his cavern he had a bed, on which, with great pretence of hospitality, he invited his guests to lie down; but if they happened to be shorter than the bed, this wicked villain stretched them out by main force; or, if they were too tall, he lopped off their heads or feet, and laughed at what he had done, as an excellent joke. Thus, however weary a man might be, he never liked to lie in the bed of Procrustes. Another of these robbers, named Scinis, must likewise have been a very great scoundrel. He was in the habit of flinging his victims off a high cliff into the sea; and, in order to give him exactly his deserts, Theseus tossed him off the very same place. But, if you will believe me, the sea would not pollute itself by receiving such a bad person into its bosom; neither would the earth, having once got rid of him, consent to take him back; so that, between the cliff and the sea, Scinis stuck fast in the air, which was forced to bear the burden of his naughtiness.\n\nAfter these memorable deeds, Theseus heard of an enormous sow, which ran wild, and was the terror of all the farmers round about; and, as he did not consider himself above doing any good thing that came in his way, he killed this monstrous creature, and gave the carcass to the poor people for bacon. The great sow had been an awful beast, while ramping about the woods and fields, but was a pleasant object enough when cut up into joints, and smoking on I know not how many dinner tables.\n\nThus, by the time he reached his journey’s end Theseus had done many valiant feats with his father’s golden-hilted sword, and had gained the renown of being one of the bravest young men of the day. His fame travelled faster than he did, and reached Athens before him. As he entered the city, he heard the inhabitants talking at the street comers and saying that Hercules was brave, and Jason too, and Castor and Pollux likewise, but that Theseus, the son of their own king, would turn out as great a hero as the best of them. Theseus took longer strides on hearing this, and fancied himself sure of a magnificent reception at his father’s court, since he came thither with Fame to blow her trumpet before him, and cry to King Ægeus, “Behold your son!”\n\nHe little suspected, innocent youth that he was, that here in this very Athens, where his father reigned, a greater danger awaited him than any which he had encountered on the road. Yet this was the truth. You must understand that the father of Theseus, though not very old in years, was almost worn out with the cares of government, and had thus grown aged before his time. His nephews, not expecting him to live a very great while, intended to get all the power of the kingdom into their own hands. But when they heard that Theseus had arrived in Athens, and learned what a gallant young man he was, they saw that he would not be at all the kind of person to let them steal away his father’s crown and scepter, which ought to be his own by right of inheritance. Thus these bad-hearted nephews of King Ægeus, who were the own cousins of Theseus, at once became his enemies. A still more dangerous enemy was Medea, the wicked enchantress; for she was now the king’s wife, and wanted to give the kingdom to her son Medus, instead of letting it be given to the son of Æthra, whom she hated.\n\nIt so happened that the king’s nephews met Theseus, and found out who he was, just as he reached the entrance of the royal palace. With all their evil designs against him, they pretended to be their cousin’s best friends and expressed great joy at making his acquaintance. They proposed to him that he should come into the king’s presence as a stranger, in order to try whether Ægeus would discover in the young man’s features any likeness either to himself or his mother Æthra, and thus recognize him for a son. Theseus consented; for he fancied that his father would know him in a moment, by the love that was in his heart. But, while he waited at the door, the nephews ran and told King Ægeus that a young man had arrived in Athens, who, to their certain knowledge intended to put him to death, and get possession of his royal crown.\n\n“And he is now waiting for admission to your majesty’s presence,” added they.\n\n“Aha!” cried the old king, on hearing this. “Why, he must be a very wicked young fellow indeed! Pray, what would you advise me to do with him?”\n\nIn reply to this question, the wicked Medea put in her word. As I have already told you, she was a famous enchantress. According to some stories, she was in the habit of boiling old people in a large caldron, under pretence of making them young[24] again; but King Ægeus, I suppose, did not fancy such an uncomfortable way of growing young, or perhaps was contented to be old, and therefore would never let himself be popped into the caldron. If there were time to spare from more important matters, I should be glad to tell you of Medea’s fiery chariot, drawn by winged dragons, in which the enchantress used often to take an airing among the clouds. This chariot, in fact, was the vehicle that first brought her to Athens, where she had done nothing but mischief ever since her arrival. But these and many other wonders must be left untold; and it is enough to say that Medea, amongst a thousand other bad things, knew how to prepare a poison that was instantly fatal to whomsoever might so much as touch it with his lips.\n\nSo when the king asked what he should do with Theseus, this naughty woman had an answer ready at her tongue’s end.\n\n“Leave that to me, please your majesty,” she replied. “Only admit this evil-minded young man to your presence, treat him civilly, and invite him to drink a goblet of wine. Your majesty is well aware that I sometimes amuse myself with distilling very powerful medicines. Here is one of them in this small phial. As to what it is made of, that is one of my secrets of state. Do but let me put a single drop into the goblet and let the young man taste it, and I shall answer for it, he shall quite lay aside the bad designs with which he comes hither.”\n\nAs she said this, Medea smiled; but, for all her smiling face, she meant nothing less than to poison the poor innocent Theseus, before his father’s eyes. And King Ægeus, like most other kings, thought any punishment mild enough for a person who was accused of plotting against his life. He therefore made little or no objection to Medea’s scheme, and as soon as the poisonous wine was ready, gave orders that the young stranger should be admitted into his presence. The goblet was set on a table beside the king’s throne; and a fly, meaning just to sip a little from the brim, immediately tumbled into it, dead. Observing this, Medea looked round at the nephews and smiled again.\n\nWhen Theseus was ushered into the royal apartment, the only object that he seemed to behold was the white-bearded old king. There he sat on his magnificent throne, a dazzling crown on his head, and a scepter in his hand. His aspect was stately and majestic, although his years and infirmities weighed heavily upon him, as if each year were a lump of lead, and each infirmity a ponderous stone, and all were bundled up together, and laid upon his weary shoulders. The tears both of joy and sorrow sprang into the young man’s eyes; for he thought how sad it was to see his dear father so infirm, and how sweet it would be to support him with his own youthful strength, and to cheer him up with the alacrity of his loving spirit. When a son takes his father into his warm heart, it renews the old man’s youth in a better way than by the heat of Medea’s magic caldron. And this was what Theseus resolved to do. He could scarcely wait to see whether King Ægeus would recognize him, so eager was he to throw himself into his arms.\n\nAdvancing to the foot of the throne, he attempted to make a little speech, which he had been thinking about, as he came up the stairs. But he was almost choked by a great many tender feelings that gushed out of his heart and swelled into his throat, all struggling to find utterance together. And therefore, unless he could have laid his full, over-brimming heart into the king’s hand, poor Theseus knew not what to do or say. The cunning Medea observed what was passing in the young man’s mind. She was more wicked at that moment than ever she had been before; for (and it makes me tremble to tell you of it) she did her worst to turn all this unspeakable love with which Theseus was agitated, to his own ruin and destruction.\n\n“Does your majesty see his confusion?” she whispered in the king’s ear. “He is so conscious of guilt, that he trembles and cannot speak. The wretch lives too long! Quick! offer him the wine!”\n\nNow King Ægeus had been gazing earnestly at the young stranger, as he drew near the throne. There was something, he knew not what, either in his white brow, or in the fine expression of his mouth, or in his beautiful and tender eyes, that made him indistinctly feel as if he had seen this youth before; as if, indeed, he had trotted him on his knee when a baby, and had beheld him growing to be a stalwart man, while he himself grew old. But Medea guessed how the king felt, and would not suffer him to yield to these natural sensibilities; although they were the voice of his deepest heart, telling him, as plainly as it could speak, that here was our dear son, and Æthra’s son, coming to claim him for a father. The enchantress again whispered in the king’s ear, and compelled him, by her witchcraft, to see everything under a false aspect.\n\nHe made up his mind, therefore, to let Theseus drink off the poisoned wine.\n\n“Young man,” said he, “you are welcome! I am proud to show hospitality to so heroic a youth. Do me the favor to drink the contents of this goblet. It is brimming over, as you see, with delicious wine, such as I bestow only on those who are worthy of it! None is more worthy to quaff it than yourself!”\n\nSo saying, King Ægeus took the golden goblet from the table, and was about to offer it to Theseus. But, partly through his infirmities, and partly because it seemed so sad a thing to take away this young man’s life, however wicked he might be, and partly, no doubt, because his heart was wiser than his head, and quaked within him at the thought of what he was going to do—for all these reasons, the king’s hand trembled so much that a great deal of the wine slopped over. In order to strengthen his purpose, and fearing lest the whole of the precious poison should be wasted, one of his nephews now whispered to him—\n\n“Has your majesty any doubt of this stranger’s guilt? There is the very sword with which he meant to slay you. How sharp, and bright, and terrible it is. Quick!—let him taste the wine; or perhaps he may do the deed even yet.”\n\nAt these words, Ægeus drove every thought and feeling out of his breast, except the one idea how justly the young man deserved to be put to death. He sat erect on his throne, and held out the goblet of wine with a steady hand, and bent on Theseus a[28] frown of kingly severity; for, after all, he had too noble a spirit to murder even a treacherous enemy with a deceitful smile upon his face.\n\n“Drink!” said he, in the stern tone with which he was wont to condemn a criminal to be beheaded. “You have well deserved of me such wine as this!”\n\nTheseus held out his hand to take the wine. But, before he touched it, King Ægeus trembled again. His eyes had fallen on the gold-hilted sword that hung at the young man’s side. He drew back the goblet.\n\n“That sword!” he exclaimed; “how came you by it?”\n\n“It was my father’s sword,” replied Theseus, with a tremulous voice. “These were his sandals. My dear mother (her name is Æthra) told me his story while I was yet a little child. But it is only a month since I grew strong enough to lift the heavy stone, and take the sword and sandals from beneath it, and come to Athens to seek my father.”\n\n“My son! my son!” cried King Ægeus, flinging away the fatal goblet, and tottering down from the throne to fall into the arms of Theseus. “Yes, these are Æthra’s eyes. It is my son.”\n\nI have quite forgotten what became of the king’s nephews. But when the wicked Medea saw this new turn of affairs, she hurried out of the room, and going to her private chamber, lost no time in setting her enchantments at work. In a few moments she heard a great noise of hissing snakes outside of the chamber window; and, behold! there was her fiery chariot, and four huge winged serpents, wriggling and twisting in the air, flourishing their tails higher than the top of the palace, and all ready to set off on an aërial journey. Medea stayed only long enough to take her son with her, and to steal the crown jewels, together with the king’s best robes, and whatever other valuable things she could lay her hands on; and getting into the chariot, she whipped up the snakes, and ascended high over the city.\n\nThe king, hearing the hiss of the serpents, scrambled as fast as he could to the window, and bawled out to the abominable enchantress never to come back. The whole people of Athens, too, who had run out of doors to see this wonderful spectacle, set up a shout of joy at the prospect of getting rid of her. Medea, almost bursting with rage, uttered precisely such a hiss as one of her own snakes, only ten times more venomous and spiteful; and glaring fiercely out of the blaze of the chariot, she shook her hands over the multitude below, as if she were scattering a million of curses among them. In so doing, however, she unintentionally let fall about five hundred diamonds of the first water, together with a thousand great pearls, and two thousand emeralds, rubies, sapphires, opals, and topazes, to which she had helped herself out of the king’s strong-box. All these came pelting down, like a shower of many-colored hailstones, upon the heads of grown people and children, who forthwith gathered them up, and carried them back to the palace. But King Ægeus told them that they were welcome to the whole, and to twice as many more, if he had them, for the sake of his delight at finding his son, and losing the wicked Medea. And, indeed, if you had seen how hateful was her last look, as the flaming chariot flew upward, you would not have wondered that both king and people should think her departure a good riddance.\n\nAnd now Prince Theseus was taken into great favor by his royal father. The old king was never weary of having him sit beside him on his throne, (which was quite wide enough for two), and of hearing him tell about his dear mother, and his childhood, and his many boyish efforts to lift the ponderous stone. Theseus, however, was much too brave and active a young man to be willing to spend all his time in relating things which had already happened. His ambition was to perform other and more heroic deeds, which should be better worth telling in prose and verse. Nor had he been long in Athens before he caught and chained a terrible mad bull, and made a public show of him, greatly to the wonder and admiration of good King Ægeus and his subjects. But pretty soon he undertook an affair that made all his foregone adventures seem like mere boy’s play. The occasion of it was as follows:—\n\nOne morning, when Prince Theseus awoke, he fancied that he must have had a very sorrowful dream, and that it was still running in his mind, even now that his eyes were open. For it appeared as if the air was full of a melancholy wail; and when he listened more attentively, he could hear sobs, and groans, and screams of woe, mingled with deep, quiet sighs, which came from the king’s palace, and from the streets, and from the temples, and from every habitation in the city. And all these mournful noises, issuing out of thousands of separate hearts, united themselves into the one great sound of affliction, which had startled Theseus from slumber. He put on his clothes as quickly as he could (not forgetting his sandals and gold-hilted sword), and hastening to the king, inquired what it all meant.\n\n“Alas! my son,” quoth King Ægeus, heaving a long sigh, “here is a very lamentable matter in hand. This is the woefulest anniversary in the whole year. It is the day when we annually draw lots to see which of the youths and maidens of Athens shall go to be devoured by the horrible Minotaur!”\n\n“The Minotaur!” exclaimed Prince Theseus; and like a brave young prince as he was, he put his hand to the hilt of his sword. “What kind of a monster may that be? Is it not possible, at the risk of one’s life, to slay him?”\n\nBut King Ægeus shook his venerable head, and to convince Theseus that it was quite a hopeless case, he gave him an explanation of the whole affair. It seems that in the island of Crete there lived a certain dreadful monster, called a Minotaur, which was shaped partly like a man and partly like a bull, and was altogether such a hideous sort of a creature that it is really disagreeable to think of him. If he were suffered to exist at all, it should have been on some desert island, or in the duskiness of some deep cavern, where nobody would ever be tormented by his abominable aspect. But King Minos, who reigned over Crete, laid out a vast deal of money in building a habitation for the Minotaur, and took great care of his health and comfort, merely for mischief’s sake. A few years before this time, there had been a war between the city of Athens and the island of Crete, in which the Athenians were beaten and compelled to beg for peace. No peace could they obtain, however, except on condition that they should send seven young men and seven maidens, every year, to be devoured by the pet monster of the cruel King Minos. For three years past, this grievous calamity had been borne. And the sobs, and groans, and shrieks, with which the city was now filled, were caused by the people’s woe, because the fatal day had come again, when the fourteen victims were to be chosen by lot, and the old people feared lest their sons or daughters might be taken, and the youths and damsels dreaded lest they themselves might be destined to glut the ravenous maw of that detestable man-brute.\n\nBut when Theseus heard the story, he straightened himself up, so that he seemed taller than ever before; and as for his face, it was indignant, despiteful, bold, tender, and compassionate, all in one look.\n\n“Let the people of Athens, this year, draw lots for only six young men, instead of seven,” said he. “I will myself be the seventh; and let the Minotaur devour me, if he can!”\n\n“O my dear son,” cried King Ægeus, “why should you expose yourself to this horrible fate? You are a royal prince, and have a right to hold yourself above the destinies of common men.”\n\n“It is because I am a prince, your son, and the rightful heir of your kingdom, that I freely take upon me the calamity of your subjects,” answered Theseus. “And you, my father, being king over this people, and answerable to heaven for their welfare, are bound to sacrifice what is dearest to you, rather than that the son or daughter of the poorest citizen should come to any harm.”\n\nThe old king shed tears, and besought Theseus not to leave him desolate in his old age, more especially as he had but just begun to know the happiness of possessing a good and valiant son. Theseus, however, felt that he was in the right, and therefore would not give up his resolution. But he assured his father that he did not intend to be eaten up, unresistingly, like a sheep, and that, if the Minotaur devoured him, it should not be without a battle for his dinner. And finally, since he could not help it, King Ægeus consented to let him go. So a vessel was got ready, and rigged with black sails; and Theseus, with six other young men, and seven tender and beautiful damsels, came down to the harbor to embark. A sorrowful multitude accompanied them to the shore. There was the poor old king, too, leaning on his son’s arm, and looking as if his single heart held all the grief of Athens.\n\nJust as Prince Theseus was going on board, his father bethought himself of one last word to say.\n\n“My beloved son,” said he, grasping the prince’s hand, “you observe that the sails of this vessel are black; as indeed they ought to be, since it goes upon a voyage of sorrow and despair. Now, being weighed down with infirmities, I know not whether I can survive till the vessel shall return. But, as long is I do live, I shall creep daily to the top of yonder cliff, to watch if there be a sail upon the sea. And, dearest Theseus, if, by some happy chance, you should escape the jaws of the Minotaur, then tear down those dismal sails, and hoist others that shall be bright as the sunshine. Beholding them on the horizon, myself and all the people will know that you are coming back victorious, and will welcome you with such a festal uproar as Athens never heard before.”\n\nTheseus promised that he would do so. Then, going on board, the mariners trimmed the vessel’s black sails to the wind, which blew faintly off the shore, being pretty much made up of the sighs that everybody kept pouring forth on this melancholy occasion. But by-and-by, when they had got fairly out to sea, there came a stiff breeze from the north-west, and drove them along as merrily over the white-capped waves as if they had been going on the most delightful errand imaginable. And though it was a sad business enough, I rather question whether fourteen young people, without any old persons to keep them in order, could continue to spend the whole time of the voyage in being miserable. There had been some few dances upon the undulating deck, I suspect, and some hearty bursts of laughter, and other such unseasonable merriment among the victims, before the high blue mountains of Crete began to show themselves among the far-off clouds. That sight, to be sure, made them all very grave again.\n\nTheseus stood among the sailors gazing eagerly towards the land; although, as yet, it seemed hardly more substantial than the clouds, amidst which the mountains were looming up. Once or twice he fancied that he saw a glare of some bright object, a[35] long way off, flinging a gleam across the waves. “Did you see that flash of light?” he inquired of the master of the vessel.\n\n“No, prince; but I have seen it before,” answered the master. “It came from Talus, I suppose.”\n\nAs the breeze came fresher just then, the master was busy with trimming his sails, and had no more time to answer questions. But while the vessel flew faster and faster towards Crete, Theseus was astonished to behold a human figure, gigantic in size, which appeared to be striding, with a measured movement, along the margin of the island. It stepped from cliff to cliff, and sometimes from one headland to another, while the sea foamed and thundered on the shore beneath, and dashed its jets of spray over the giant’s feet. What was still more remarkable, whenever the sun shone on this huge figure, it flickered and glimmered; its vast countenance, too, had a metallic luster, and threw great flashes of splendor through the air. The folds of its garments, moreover, instead of waving in the wind, fell heavily over its limbs, as if woven of some kind of metal.\n\nThe nigher the vessel came, the more Theseus wondered what this immense giant could be, and whether it actually had life or no. For, though it walked, and made other life-like motions, there yet was a kind of jerk in its gait, which, together with its brazen aspect, caused the young prince to suspect that it was no true giant, but only a wonderful piece of machinery. The figure looked all the more terrible because it carried an enormous brass club on its shoulder.\n\n“What is this wonder?” Theseus asked of the master of the vessel, who was now at leisure to answer him.\n\n“It is Talus, the Man of Brass,” said the master.\n\n“And is he a live giant, or a brazen image?” asked Theseus.\n\n“That, truly,” replied the master, “is the point which has always perplexed me. Some say, indeed, that this Talus was hammered out for King Minos by Vulcan himself, the skilfulest of all workers in metal. But who ever saw a brazen image that had sense enough to walk round an island three times a day, as this giant walks round the island of Crete, challenging every vessel that comes nigh the shore? And, on the other hand, what living thing, unless his sinews were made of brass, would not be weary of marching eighteen hundred miles in the twenty-four hours, as Talus does, without ever sitting down to rest? He is a puzzler, take him how you will.”\n\nStill the vessel went bounding onward; and now Theseus could hear the brazen clangor of the giant’s footsteps, as he trod heavily upon the sea-beaten rocks, some of which were seen to crack and crumble into the foamy waves beneath his weight. As they approached the entrance of the port the giant straddled clear across it, with a foot firmly planted on each headland, and uplifting his club to such a height that its butt-end was hidden in a cloud, he stood in that formidable posture, with the sun gleaming all over his metallic surface. There seemed nothing else to be expected but that, the next moment, he would fetch his great club down, slam bang, and smash the vessel into a thousand pieces, without heeding how many innocent people he might destroy; for there is seldom any mercy in a giant, you know, and quite as little in a piece of brass clockwork. But just when Theseus and his companions thought the blow was coming, the brazen lips unclosed themselves, and the figure spoke.\n\n“Whence come you, strangers?”\n\nAnd when the ringing voice ceased, there was just such a reverberation as you may have heard within a great church bell, for a moment or two after the stroke of the hammer.\n\n“From Athens!” shouted the master in reply.\n\n“On what errand?” thundered the Man of Brass.\n\nAnd he whirled his club aloft more threateningly than ever, as if he were about to smite them with a thunderstroke right amidships, because Athens, so little while ago, had been at war with Crete.\n\n“We bring the seven youths and the seven maidens,” answered the master, “to be devoured by the Minotaur!”\n\n“Pass!” cried the brazen giant.\n\nThat one loud word rolled all about the sky, while again there was a booming reverberation within the figure’s breast. The vessel glided between the headlands of the port, and the giant resumed his march. In a few moments, this wondrous sentinel was far away, flashing in the distant sunshine, and revolving with immense strides around the island of Crete, as it was his never-ceasing task to do.\n\nNo sooner had they entered the harbor than a party of the guards of King Minos came down to the water side, and took charge of the fourteen young men and damsels. Surrounded by these armed warriors, Prince Theseus and his companions were led to the king’s palace, and ushered into his presence. Now, Minos was a stern and pitiless king. If the figure that guarded Crete was made of brass, then the monarch, who ruled over it, might be thought to have a still harder metal in his breast, and might have been called a man of iron. He bent his shaggy brows upon the poor Athenian victims. Any other mortal, beholding their fresh and tender beauty, and their innocent looks, would have felt himself sitting on thorns until he had made every soul of them happy, by bidding them go free as the summer wind. But this immitigable Minos cared only to examine whether they were plump enough to satisfy the Minotaur’s appetite. For my part, I wish he himself had been the only victim; and the monster would have found him a pretty tough one.\n\nOne after another, King Minos called these pale frightened youths and sobbing maidens to his footstool, gave them each a poke in the ribs with his scepter (to try whether they were in good flesh or no), and dismissed them with a nod to his guards. But when his eyes rested on Theseus, the king looked at him more attentively, because his face was calm and brave.\n\n“Young man,” asked he, with his stern voice, “are you not appalled at the certainty of being devoured by this terrible Minotaur?”\n\n“I have offered my life in a good cause,” answered Theseus, “and therefore I give it freely and gladly. But thou, King Minos, art thou not[39] thyself appalled, who, year after year, hast perpetrated this dreadful wrong, by giving seven innocent youths and as many maidens to be devoured by a monster? Dost thou not tremble, wicked king, to turn thine eyes inward on thine own heart? Sitting there on thy golden throne, and in thy robes of majesty, I tell thee to thy face, King Minos, thou art a more hideous monster than the Minotaur himself!”\n\n“Aha! do you think me so?” cried the king, laughing in his cruel way. “To-morrow, at breakfast time, you shall have an opportunity of judging which is the greater monster, the Minotaur or the king! Take them away, guards; and let this free-spoken youth be the Minotaur’s first morsel!”\n\nNear the king’s throne (though I had no time to tell you so before) stood his daughter Ariadne. She was a beautiful and tender-hearted maiden, and looked at these poor doomed captives with very different feelings from those of the iron-breasted King Minos. She really wept, indeed, at the idea of how much human happiness would be needlessly thrown away, by giving so many young people, in the first bloom and rose blossom of their lives, to be eaten up by a creature who, no doubt, would have preferred a fat ox, or even a large pig, to the plumpest of them. And when she beheld the brave, spirited figure of Prince Theseus bearing himself so calmly in his terrible peril, she grew a hundred times more pitiful than before. As the guards were taking him away, she flung herself at the king’s feet, and besought him to set all the captives free, and especially this one young man.\n\n“Peace, foolish girl!” answered King Minos. “What hast thou to do with an affair like this? It is a matter of state policy, and therefore quite beyond thy weak comprehension. Go water thy flowers, and think no more of these Athenian caitiffs, whom the Minotaur shall as certainly eat up for breakfast as I will eat a partridge for my supper.”\n\nSo saying, the king looked cruel enough to devour Theseus and all the rest of the captives, himself, had there been no Minotaur to save him the trouble. As he would hear not another word in their favor, the prisoners were now led away, and clapped into a dungeon, where the jailer advised to go to sleep as soon as possible, because the Minotaur was in the habit of calling for breakfast early. The seven maidens and six of the young men soon sobbed themselves to slumber. But Theseus was not like them. He felt conscious that he was wiser, and braver, and stronger than his companions, and that therefore he had the responsibility of all their lives upon him, and must consider whether there was no way to save them, even in this last extremity. So he kept himself awake, and paced to and fro across the gloomy dungeon in which they were shut up.\n\nJust before midnight, the door was softly unbarred, and the gentle Ariadne showed herself, with a torch in her hand.\n\n“Are you awake, Prince Theseus?” she whispered.\n\n“Yes,” answered Theseus. “With so little time to live, I do not choose to waste any of it in sleep.”\n\n“Then follow me,” said Ariadne, “and tread softly.”\n\nWhat had become of the jailer and the guards, Theseus never knew. But, however that might be, Ariadne opened all the doors, and led him forth from the darksome prison into the pleasant moonlight.\n\n“Theseus,” said the maiden, “you can now get on board your vessel, and sail away for Athens.”\n\n“No,” answered the young man; “I will never leave Crete unless I can first slay the Minotaur, and save my poor companions, and deliver Athens from this cruel tribute.”\n\n“I knew that this would be your resolution,” said Ariadne. “Come, then, with me, brave Theseus. Here is your own sword, which the guards deprived you of. You will need it; and pray Heaven you may use it well.”\n\nThen she led Theseus along by the hand until they came to a dark, shadowy grove, where the moonlight wasted itself on the tops of the trees, without shedding hardly so much as a glimmering beam upon their pathway. After going a good way through this obscurity, they reached a high marble wall, which was overgrown with creeping plants, that made it shaggy with their verdure. The wall seemed to have no door, nor any windows, but rose up, lofty, and massive, and mysterious, and was neither to be clambered over, nor, so far as Theseus could perceive, to be passed through. Nevertheless, Ariadne did but press one of her soft little fingers against a particular block of marble, and, though it looked as solid as any other part of the wall, it yielded to her touch, disclosing an entrance just wide enough to admit them. They crept through, and the marble stone swung back into its place.\n\n“We are now,” said Ariadne, “in the famous labyrinth which Dædalus built before he made himself a pair of wings, and flew away from our island like a bird. That Dædalus was a very cunning workman; but of all his artful contrivances, this labyrinth is the most wondrous. Were we to take but a few steps from the doorway, we might wander about all our lifetime, and never find it again. Yet in the very center of this labyrinth is the Minotaur and, Theseus, you must go thither to seek him.”\n\n“But how shall I ever find him,” asked Theseus, “if the labyrinth so bewilders me as you say it will?”\n\nJust as he spoke, they heard a rough and very disagreeable roar, which greatly resembled the lowing of a fierce bull, but yet had some sort of sound like the human voice. Theseus even fancied a rude articulation in it, as if the creature that uttered it were trying to shape his hoarse breath into words. It was at some distance, however, and he really could not tell whether it sounded most like a bull’s roar or a man’s harsh voice.\n\n“That is the Minotaur’s noise,” whispered Ariadne, closely grasping the hand of Theseus, and pressing one of her own hands to her heart, which was all in a tremble. “You must follow that sound through the windings of the labyrinth, and, by and by, you will find him. Stay! take the end of this silken string, I will hold the other end; and then, if you win the victory, it will lead you again to this spot. Farewell, brave Theseus.”\n\nSo the young man took the end of the silken string in his left hand, and his gold-hilted sword, ready drawn from its scabbard, in the other, and trod boldly into the inscrutable labyrinth. How this labyrinth was built is more than I can tell you, but so cunningly contrived a mizmaze was never seen in the world, before nor since. There can be nothing else so intricate, unless it were the brain of a man like Dædalus, who planned it, or the heart of any ordinary man; which last, to be sure, is ten times as great a mystery as the labyrinth of Crete. Theseus had not taken five steps before he lost sight of Ariadne and in five more his head was growing dizzy. But still he went on, now creeping through a low arch, now ascending a flight of steps, now in one crooked passage, and now in another, with here a door opening before him, and there one hanging behind, until it really seemed as if the walls spun round, and whirled him round along with them. And all the while, through these hollow avenues, now nearer, now farther off again, resounded the cry of the Minotaur; and the sound was so fierce, so cruel, so ugly, so like a bull’s roar, and withal so like a human voice, and yet like neither of them, that the brave heart of Theseus grew sterner and angrier at every step; for he felt it an insult to the moon and sky, and to our affectionate and simple Mother Earth, that such a monster should have the audacity to exist.\n\nAs he passed onward, the clouds gathered over the moon, and the labyrinth grew so dusky that Theseus could no longer discern the bewilderment through which he was passing. He would have felt quite lost, and utterly hopeless of ever again walking in a straight path, if, every little while, he had not been conscious of a gentle twitch at the silken cord. Then he knew that the tender-hearted Ariadne was still holding the other end, and that she was fearing for him, and hoping for him, and giving him just as much of her sympathy as if she were close by his side. Oh, indeed, I can assure you, there, was a vast deal of human sympathy running along that slender thread of silk. But still he followed the dreadful roar of the Minotaur, which now grew louder and louder, and finally so very loud that Theseus fully expected to come close upon him, at every new zigzag and wriggle of the path. And at last, in an open space, at the very center of the labyrinth, he did discern the hideous creature.\n\nSure enough, what an ugly monster it was! Only his horned head belonged to a bull; and yet, somehow or other, he looked like a bull all over, preposterously waddling on his hind legs; or, if you happened to view him in another way, he seemed wholly a man, and all the more monstrous for being so. And there he was, the wretched thing, with no society, no companion, no kind of a mate, living only to do mischief, and incapable of knowing what affection means. Theseus hated him, and shuddered at him, and yet could not but be sensible of some sort of pity; and all the more, the uglier and more detestable the creature was. For he kept striding to and fro, in a solitary frenzy of rage, continually emitting a hoarse roar, which was oddly mixed up with half-shaped words; and, after listening a while, Theseus understood that the Minotaur was saying to himself how miserable he was, and how hungry, and how he hated everybody, and how he longed to eat up the human race alive.\n\nAh, the bull-headed villain! And oh, my good little people, you will perhaps see, one of these days, as I do now, that every human being who suffers anything evil to get into his nature, or to remain there, is a kind of Minotaur, an enemy of his fellow-creatures, and separated from all good companionship, as this poor monster was.\n\nWas Theseus afraid? By no means, my dear auditors. What! a hero like Theseus afraid! Not had the Minotaur had twenty bull heads instead of one. Bold as he was, however, I rather fancy that it strengthened his valiant heart, just at this crisis, to feel a tremulous twitch at the silken cord, which he was still holding in his left hand. It was as if Ariadne were giving him all her might and courage; and, much as he already had, and little as she had to give, it made his own seem twice as much. And to confess the honest truth, he needed the whole, for now the Minotaur, turning suddenly about, caught sight of Theseus, and instantly lowered his horribly sharp horns, exactly as a mad bull does when he means to rush against an enemy. At the same time, he belched forth a tremendous roar, in which there was something like the words of human language, but all disjointed and shaken to pieces by passing through the gullet of a miserably enraged brute.\n\nTheseus could only guess what the creature intended to say, and that rather by his gestures than his words, for the Minotaur’s horns were sharper than his wits, and of a great deal more service to him than his tongue. But probably this was the sense of what he uttered:\n\n“Ah, wretch of a human being! I’ll stick my horns through you, and toss you fifty feet high, and eat you up the moment you come down.”\n\n“Come on, then, and try it!” was all that Theseus deigned to reply; for he was far too magnanimous to assault his enemy with insolent language.\n\nWithout more words on either side, there ensued the most awful fight between Theseus and the Minotaur that ever happened beneath the sun or moon. I really know not how it might have turned out, if the monster, in his first headlong rush against Theseus, had not missed him, by a hair’s breadth, and broken one of his horns short off against the stone wall. On this mishap he bellowed so intolerably that a part of the labyrinth tumbled down, and all the inhabitants of Crete mistook the noise for an uncommonly heavy thunder-storm. Smarting with the pain, he galloped around the open space in so ridiculous a way that Theseus laughed at it, long afterwards, though not precisely at the moment. After this, the two antagonists stood valiantly up to one another, and fought sword to horn, for a long while. At last, the Minotaur made a run at Theseus, grazed his left side with his horn, and flung him down; and thinking that he had stabbed him to the heart, he cut a great caper in the air, opened his bull mouth from ear to ear, and prepared to snap his head off. But Theseus by this time had leaped up, and caught the monster off his guard. Fetching a sword stroke at him with all his force, he hit him fair upon the neck, and made his bull head skip six yards from his human body, which fell down flat upon the ground.\n\nSo now the battle was ended. Immediately the moon shone out as brightly as if all the troubles of the world, and all the wickedness and the ugliness that infest human life, were past and gone forever. And Theseus, as he leaned on his sword taking breath, felt another twitch of the silken cord; for all through the terrible encounter, he had held it fast in his left hand. Eager to let Ariadne know of his success, he followed the guidance of the thread, and soon found himself at the entrance of the labyrinth.\n\n“Thou hast slain the monster,” cried Ariadne, clasping her hands.\n\n“Thanks to thee, dear Ariadne,” answered Theseus, “I return victorious.”\n\n“Then,” said Ariadne, “we must quickly summon thy friends, and get them and thyself on board the vessel before dawn. If morning finds thee here, my father will avenge the Minotaur.”\n\nTo make my story short, the poor captives were awakened, and, hardly knowing whether it was not a joyful dream, were told of what Theseus had done, and that they must set sail for Athens before daybreak. Hastening down to the vessel, they all clambered on board, except Prince Theseus, who lingered behind them on the strand, holding Ariadne’s hand clasped in his own.\n\n“Dear maiden,” said he, “thou wilt surely go with us. Thou art too gentle and sweet a child for such an iron-hearted father as King Minos. He cares no more for thee than a granite rock cares for the little flower that grows in one of its crevices. But my father King Ægeus, and my dear mother, Æthra, and all the fathers and mothers in Athens, and all the sons and daughters too, will love and honor thee as their benefactress. Come with us, then; for King Minos will be very angry when he knows what thou hast done.”\n\nNow, some low-minded people, who pretend to tell the story of Theseus and Ariadne, have the face to say that this royal and honorable maiden did really flee away, under cover of the night, with the young stranger whose life she had preserved. They say, too, that Prince Theseus (who could have died sooner than wrong the meanest creature in the world) ungratefully deserted Ariadne on a solitary island, where the vessel touched on its voyage to Athens. But, had the noble Theseus heard these falsehoods, he would have served their slanderous authors as he served the Minotaur! Here is what Ariadne answered, when the brave Prince of Athens besought her to accompany him:\n\n“No, Theseus,” the maiden said, pressing his hand, and then drawing back a step or two, “I cannot go with you. My father is old, and has nobody but myself to love him. Hard as you think his heart is, it would break to lose me. At first, King Minos will be angry; but he will soon forgive his only child; and, by and by, he will rejoice, I know, that no more youths and maidens must come from Athens to be devoured by the Minotaur. I have saved you, Theseus, as much for my father’s sake as for your own. Farewell! Heaven bless you!”\n\nAll this was so true, and so maiden-like, and was spoken with so sweet a dignity, that Theseus would have blushed to urge her any longer. Nothing remained for him, therefore, but to bid Ariadne an affectionate farewell, and to go on board the vessel, and set sail.\n\nIn a few moments the white foam was boiling up before their prow, as Prince Theseus and his companions sailed out of the harbor, with a whistling breeze behind them. Talus, the brazen giant, on his never-ceasing sentinel’s march, happened to be approaching that part of the coast; and they saw him, by the glimmering of the moonbeams on his polished surface, while he was yet a great way off. As the figure moved like clockwork, however, and could neither hasten his enormous strides nor retard them, he arrived at the port when they were just beyond the reach of his club. Nevertheless, straddling from headland to headland, as his custom was, Talus attempted to strike a blow at the vessel, and, overreaching himself, tumbled at full length into the sea, which splashed high over his gigantic shape, as when an iceberg turns a somerset. There he lies yet; and whoever desires to enrich himself by means of brass had better go thither with a diving bell, and fish up Talus.\n\nOn the homeward voyage, the fourteen youths and damsels were in excellent spirits, as you will easily suppose. They spent most of their time in dancing, unless when the sidelong breeze made the deck slope too much. In due season, they came within sight of the coast of Attica, which was their native country. But here, I am grieved to tell you, happened a sad misfortune.\n\nYou will remember (what Theseus unfortunately forgot) that his father, King Ægeus, had enjoined it upon him to hoist sunshiny sails, instead of black ones, in case he should overcome the Minotaur, and return victorious. In the joy of their success, however, and amidst the sports, dancing, and other merriment, with which these young folks wore away the time, they never once thought whether their sails were black, white, or rainbow colored, and, indeed, left it entirely to the mariners whether they had any sails at all. Thus the vessel returned, like a raven, with the same sable wings that had wafted her away. But poor King Ægeus, day after day, infirm as he was, had clambered to the summit of a cliff that overhung the sea, and there sat watching for Prince Theseus, homeward bound; and no sooner did he behold the fatal blackness of the sails, than he concluded that his dear son, whom he loved so much, and felt so proud of, had been eaten by the Minotaur. He could not bear the thought of living any longer; so, first flinging his crown and scepter into the sea (useless baubles that they were to him now!) King Ægeus merely stooped forward, and fell headlong over the cliff, and was drowned, poor soul, in the waves that foamed at its base!\n\nThis was melancholy news for Prince Theseus, who when he stepped ashore, found himself king of all the country, whether he would or no; and such a turn of fortune was enough to make any young man feel very much out of spirits. However, he sent for his dear mother to Athens, and, by taking her advice in matters of state, became a very excellent monarch, and was greatly beloved by his people.",

    "content": "One afternoon, when the sun was going down, a mother and her little boy sat at the door of their cottage, talking about the Great Stone Face. They had but to lift their eyes, and there it was plainly to be seen, though miles away, with the sunshine brightening all its features.\n\nAnd what was the Great Stone Face?\n\nEmbosomed amongst a family of lofty mountains, there was a valley so spacious that it contained many thousand inhabitants. Some of these good people dwelt in log-huts, with the black forest all around them, on the steep and difficult hill-sides. Others had their homes in comfortable farm-houses, and cultivated the rich soil on the gentle slopes or level surfaces of the valley. Others, again, were congregated into populous villages, where some wild, highland rivulet, tumbling down from its birthplace in the upper mountain region, had been caught and tamed by human cunning, and compelled to turn the machinery of cotton-factories. The inhabitants of this valley, in short, were numerous, and of many modes of life. But all of them, grown people and children, had a kind of familiarity with the Great Stone Face, although some possessed the gift of distinguishing this grand natural phenomenon more perfectly than many of their neighbors.\n\nThe Great Stone Face, then, was a work of Nature in her mood of majestic playfulness, formed on the perpendicular side of a mountain by some immense rocks, which had been thrown together in such a position as, when viewed at a proper distance, precisely to resemble the features of the human countenance. It seemed as if an enormous giant, or a Titan, had sculptured his own likeness on the precipice. There was the broad arch of the forehead, a hundred feet in height; the nose, with its long bridge; and the vast lips, which, if they could have spoken, would have rolled their thunder accents from one end of the valley to the other. True it is, that if the spectator approached too near, he lost the outline of the gigantic visage, and could discern only a heap of ponderous and gigantic rocks, piled in chaotic ruin one upon another. Retracing his steps, however, the wondrous features would again be seen; and the farther he withdrew from them, the more like a human face, with all its original divinity intact, did they appear; until, as it grew dim in the distance, with the clouds and glorified vapor of the mountains clustering about it, the Great Stone Face seemed positively to be alive.\n\nIt was a happy lot for children to grow up to manhood or womanhood with the Great Stone Face before their eyes, for all the features were noble, and the expression was at once grand and sweet, as if it were the glow of a vast, warm heart, that embraced all mankind in its affections, and had room for more. It was an education only to look at it. According to the belief of many people, the valley owed much of its fertility to this benign aspect that was continually beaming over it, illuminating the clouds, and infusing its tenderness into the sunshine.\n\nAs we began with saying, a mother and her little boy sat at their cottage-door, gazing at the Great Stone Face, and talking about it. The child's name was Ernest.\n\n\"Mother,\" said he, while the Titanic visage smiled on him, \"I wish that it could speak, for it looks so very kindly that its voice must needs be pleasant. If I were to see a man with such a face, I should love him dearly.\"\n\n\"If an old prophecy should come to pass,\" answered his mother, \"we may see a man, some time or other, with exactly such a face as that.\"\n\n\"What prophecy do you mean, dear mother?\" eagerly inquired Ernest. \"Pray tell me about it!\"\n\nSo his mother told him a story that her own mother had told to her, when she herself was younger than little Ernest; a story, not of things that were past, but of what was yet to come; a story, nevertheless, so very old, that even the Indians, who formerly inhabited this valley, had heard it from their forefathers, to whom, as they affirmed, it had been murmured by the mountain streams, and whispered by the wind among the tree-tops. The purport was, that, at some future day, a child should be born hereabouts, who was destined to become the greatest and noblest personage of his time, and whose countenance, in manhood, should bear an exact resemblance to the Great Stone Face. Not a few old-fashioned people, and young ones likewise, in the ardor of their hopes, still cherished an enduring faith in this old prophecy. But others, who had seen more of the world, had watched and waited till they were weary, and had beheld no man with such a face, nor any man that proved to be much greater or nobler than his neighbors, concluded it to be nothing but an idle tale. At all events, the great man of the prophecy had not yet appeared.\n\n\"O mother, dear mother!\" cried Ernest, clapping his hands above his head, \"I do hope that I shall live to see him!\"\n\nHis mother was an affectionate and thoughtful woman, and felt that it was wisest not to discourage the generous hopes of her little boy. So she only said to him, \"Perhaps you may.\"\n\nAnd Ernest never forgot the story that his mother told him. It was always in his mind, whenever he looked upon the Great Stone Face. He spent his childhood in the log-cottage where he was born, and was dutiful to his mother, and helpful to her in many things, assisting her much with his little hands, and more with his loving heart. In this manner, from a happy yet often pensive child, he grew up to be a mild, quiet, unobtrusive boy, and sun-browned with labor in the fields, but with more intelligence brightening his aspect than is seen in many lads who have been taught at famous schools. Yet Ernest had had no teacher, save only that the Great Stone Face became one to him. When the toil of the day was over, he would gaze at it for hours, until he began to imagine that those vast features recognized him, and gave him a smile of kindness and encouragement, responsive to his own look of veneration. We must not take upon us to affirm that this was a mistake, although the Face may have looked no more kindly at Ernest than at all the world besides. But the secret was that the boy's tender and confiding simplicity discerned what other people could not see; and thus the love, which was meant for all, became his peculiar portion.\n\nAbout this time there went a rumor throughout the valley, that the great man, foretold from ages long ago, who was to bear a resemblance to the Great Stone Face, had appeared at last. It seems that, many years before, a young man had migrated from the valley and settled at a distant seaport, where, after getting together a little money, he had set up as a shopkeeper. His name--but I could never learn whether it was his real one, or a nickname that had grown out of his habits and success in life--was Gathergold. Being shrewd and active, and endowed by Providence with that inscrutable faculty which develops itself in what the world calls luck, he became an exceedingly rich merchant, and owner of a whole fleet of bulky-bottomed ships. All the countries of the globe appeared to join hands for the mere purpose of adding heap after heap to the mountainous accumulation of this one man's wealth. The cold regions of the north, almost within the gloom and shadow of the Arctic Circle, sent him their tribute in the shape of furs; hot Africa sifted for him the golden sands of her rivers, and gathered up the ivory tusks of her great elephants out of the forests; the East came bringing him the rich shawls, and spices, and teas, and the effulgence of diamonds, and the gleaming purity of large pearls. The ocean, not to be behindhand with the earth, yielded up her mighty whales, that Mr. Gathergold might sell their oil, and make a profit of it. Be the original commodity what it might, it was gold within his grasp. It might be said of him, as of Midas in the fable, that whatever he touched with his finger immediately glistened, and grew yellow, and was changed at once into sterling metal, or, which suited him still better, into piles of coin. And, when Mr. Gathergold had become so very rich that it would have taken him a hundred years only to count his wealth, he bethought himself of his native valley, and resolved to go back thither, and end his days where he was born. With this purpose in view, he sent a skilful architect to build him such a palace as should be fit for a man of his vast wealth to live in.\n\nAs I have said above, it had already been rumored in the valley that Mr. Gathergold had turned out to be the prophetic personage so long and vainly looked for, and that his visage was the perfect and undeniable similitude of the Great Stone Face. People were the more ready to believe that this must needs be the fact, when they beheld the splendid edifice that rose, as if by enchantment, on the site of his father's old weatherbeaten farm-house. The exterior was of marble, so dazzlingly white that it seemed as though the whole structure might melt away in the sunshine, like those humbler ones which Mr. Gathergold, in his young play-days, before his fingers were gifted with the touch of transmutation, had been accustomed to build of snow. It had a richly ornamented portico, supported by tall pillars, beneath which was a lofty door, studded with silver knobs, and made of a kind of variegated wood that had been brought from beyond the sea. The windows, from the floor to the ceiling of each stately apartment, were composed, respectively, of but one enormous pane of glass, so transparently pure that it was said to be a finer medium than even the vacant atmosphere. Hardly anybody had been permitted to see the interior of this palace; but it was reported, and with good semblance of truth, to be far more gorgeous than the outside, insomuch that whatever was iron or brass in other houses was silver or gold in this; and Mr. Gathergold's bedchamber, especially, made such a glittering appearance that no ordinary man would have been able to close his eyes there. But, on the other hand, Mr. Gathergold was now so inured to wealth, that perhaps he could not have closed his eyes unless where the gleam of it was certain to find its way beneath his eyelids.\n\nIn due time, the mansion was finished; next came the upholsterers, with magnificent furniture; then, a whole troop of black and white servants, the harbingers of Mr. Gathergold, who, in his own majestic person, was expected to arrive at sunset. Our friend Ernest, meanwhile, had been deeply stirred by the idea that the great man, the noble man, the man of prophecy, after so many ages of delay, was at length to be made manifest to his native valley. He knew, boy as he was, that there were a thousand ways in which Mr. Gathergold, with his vast wealth, might transform himself into an angel of beneficence, and assume a control over human affairs as wide and benignant as the smile of the Great Stone Face. Full of faith and hope, Ernest doubted not that what the people said was true, and that now he was to behold the living likeness of those wondrous features on the mountain-side. While the boy was still gazing up the valley, and fancying, as he always did, that the Great Stone Face returned his gaze and looked kindly at him, the rumbling of wheels was heard, approaching swiftly along the winding road.\n\n\"Here he comes!\" cried a group of people who were assembled to witness the arrival. \"Here comes the great Mr. Gathergold!\"\n\nA carriage, drawn by four horses, dashed round the turn of the road. Within it, thrust partly out of the window, appeared the physiognomy of the old man, with a skin as yellow as if his own Midas-hand had transmuted it. He had a low forehead, small, sharp eyes, puckered about with innumerable wrinkles, and very thin lips, which he made still thinner by pressing them forcibly together.\n\n\"The very image of the Great Stone Face!\" shouted the people. \"Sure enough, the old prophecy is true; and here we have the great man come, at last!\"\n\nAnd, what greatly perplexed Ernest, they seemed actually to believe that here was the likeness which they spoke of. By the roadside there chanced to be an old beggar-woman and two little beggar-children, stragglers from some far-off region, who, as the carriage rolled onward, held out their hands and lifted up their doleful voices, most piteously beseeching charity. A yellow claw--the very same that had clawed together so much wealth--poked itself out of the coach-window, and dropt some copper coins upon the ground; so that, though the great man's name seems to have been Gathergold, he might just as suitably have been nicknamed Scattercopper. Still, nevertheless, with an earnest shout, and evidently with as much good faith as ever, the people bellowed, \"He is the very image of the Great Stone Face!\"\n\nBut Ernest turned sadly from the wrinkled shrewdness of that sordid visage, and gazed up the valley, where, amid a gathering mist, gilded by the last sunbeams, he could still distinguish those glorious features which had impressed themselves into his soul. Their aspect cheered him. What did the benign lips seem to say?\n\n\"He will come! Fear not, Ernest; the man will come!\"\n\nThe years went on, and Ernest ceased to be a boy. He had grown to be a young man now. He attracted little notice from the other inhabitants of the valley; for they saw nothing remarkable in his way of life save that, when the labor of the day was over, he still loved to go apart and gaze and meditate upon the Great Stone Face. According to their idea of the matter, it was a folly, indeed, but pardonable, inasmuch as Ernest was industrious, kind, and neighborly, and neglected no duty for the sake of indulging this idle habit. They knew not that the Great Stone Face had become a teacher to him, and that the sentiment which was expressed in it would enlarge the young man's heart, and fill it with wider and deeper sympathies than other hearts. They knew not that thence would come a better wisdom than could be learned from books, and a better life than could be moulded on the defaced example of other human lives. Neither did Ernest know that the thoughts and affections which came to him so naturally, in the fields and at the fireside, and wherever he communed with himself, were of a higher tone than those which all men shared with him. A simple soul,--simple as when his mother first taught him the old prophecy,--he beheld the marvellous features beaming adown the valley, and still wondered that their human counterpart was so long in making his appearance.\n\nBy this time poor Mr. Gathergold was dead and buried; and the oddest part of the matter was, that his wealth, which was the body and spirit of his existence, had disappeared before his death, leaving nothing of him but a living skeleton, covered over with a wrinkled yellow skin. Since the melting away of his gold, it had been very generally conceded that there was no such striking resemblance, after all, betwixt the ignoble features of the ruined merchant and that majestic face upon the mountain-side. So the people ceased to honor him during his lifetime, and quietly consigned him to forgetfulness after his decease. Once in a while, it is true, his memory was brought up in connection with the magnificent palace which he had built, and which had long ago been turned into a hotel for the accommodation of strangers, multitudes of whom came, every summer, to visit that famous natural curiosity, the Great Stone Face. Thus, Mr. Gathergold being discredited and thrown into the shade, the man of prophecy was yet to come.\n\nIt so happened that a native-born son of the valley, many years before, had enlisted as a soldier, and, after a great deal of hard fighting, had now become an illustrious commander. Whatever he may be called in history, he was known in camps and on the battle-field under the nickname of Old Blood-and-Thunder. This war-worn veteran being now infirm with age and wounds, and weary of the turmoil of a military life, and of the roll of the drum and the clangor of the trumpet, that had so long been ringing in his ears, had lately signified a purpose of returning to his native valley, hoping to find repose where he remembered to have left it. The inhabitants, his old neighbors and their grown-up children, were resolved to welcome the renowned warrior with a salute of cannon and a public dinner; and all the more enthusiastically, it being affirmed that now, at last, the likeness of the Great Stone Face had actually appeared. An aid-de-camp of Old Blood-and-Thunder, travelling through the valley, was said to have been struck with the resemblance. Moreover the schoolmates and early acquaintances of the general were ready to testify, on oath, that, to the best of their recollection, the aforesaid general had been exceedingly like the majestic image, even when a boy, only the idea had never occurred to them at that period. Great, therefore, was the excitement throughout the valley; and many people, who had never once thought of glancing at the Great Stone Face for years before, now spent their time in gazing at it, for the sake of knowing exactly how General Blood-and-Thunder looked.\n\nOn the day of the great festival, Ernest, with all the other people of the valley, left their work, and proceeded to the spot where the sylvan banquet was prepared. As he approached, the loud voice of the Rev. Dr. Battleblast was heard, beseeching a blessing on the good things set before them, and on the distinguished friend of peace in whose honor they were assembled. The tables were arranged in a cleared space of the woods, shut in by the surrounding trees, except where a vista opened eastward, and afforded a distant view of the Great Stone Face. Over the general's chair, which was a relic from the home of Washington, there was an arch of verdant boughs, with the laurel profusely intermixed, and surmounted by his country's banner, beneath which he had won his victories. Our friend Ernest raised himself on his tiptoes, in hopes to get a glimpse of the celebrated guest; but there was a mighty crowd about the tables anxious to hear the toasts and speeches, and to catch any word that might fall from the general in reply; and a volunteer company, doing duty as a guard, pricked ruthlessly with their bayonets at any particularly quiet person among the throng. So Ernest, being of an unobtrusive character, was thrust quite into the background, where he could see no more of Old Blood-and-Thunder's physiognomy than if it had been still blazing on the battle-field. To console himself, he turned towards the Great Stone Face, which, like a faithful and long remembered friend, looked back and smiled upon him through the vista of the forest. Meantime, however, he could overhear the remarks of various individuals, who were comparing the features of the hero with the face on the distant mountain-side.\n\n\" 'Tis the same face, to a hair!\" cried one man, cutting a caper for joy.\n\n\"Wonderfully like, that's a fact!\" responded another.\n\n\"Like! why, I call it Old Blood-and-Thunder himself, in a monstrous looking-glass!\" cried a third. \"And why not? He's the greatest man of this or any other age, beyond a doubt.\"\n\nAnd then all three of the speakers gave a great shout, which communicated electricity to the crowd, and called forth a roar from a thousand voices, that went reverberating for miles among the mountains, until you might have supposed that the Great Stone Face had poured its thunderbreath into the cry. All these comments, and this vast enthusiasm, served the more to interest our friend; nor did he think of questioning that now, at length, the mountain-visage had found its human counterpart. It is true, Ernest had imagined that this long-looked-for personage would appear in the character of a man of peace, uttering wisdom, and doing good, and making people happy. But, taking an habitual breadth of view, with all his simplicity, he contended that Providence should choose its own method of blessing mankind, and could conceive that this great end might be effected even by a warrior and a bloody sword, should inscrutable wisdom see fit to order matters so.\n\n\"The general! the general!\" was now the cry. \"Hush! silence! Old Blood-and-Thunder's going to make a speech.\"\n\nEven so; for, the cloth being removed, the general's health had been drunk, amid shouts of applause, and he now stood upon his feet to thank the company. Ernest saw him. There he was, over the shoulders of the crowd, from the two glittering epaulets and embroidered collar upward, beneath the arch of green boughs with intertwined laurel, and the banner drooping as if to shade his brow! And there, too, visible in the same glance, through the vista of the forest, appeared the Great Stone Face! And was there, indeed, such a resemblance as the crowd had testified? Alas, Ernest could not recognize it! He beheld a war-worn and weatherbeaten countenance, full of energy, and expressive of an iron will; but the gentle wisdom, the deep, broad, tender sympathies, were altogether wanting in Old Blood-and-Thunder's visage; and even if the Great Stone Face had assumed his look of stern command, the milder traits would still have tempered it.\n\n\"This is not the man of prophecy,\" sighed Ernest to himself, as he made his way out of the throng. \"And must the world wait longer yet?\"\n\nThe mists had congregated about the distant mountain-side, and there were seen the grand and awful features of the Great Stone Face, awful but benignant, as if a mighty angel were sitting among the hills, and enrobing himself in a cloud-vesture of gold and purple. As he looked, Ernest could hardly believe but that a smile beamed over the whole visage, with a radiance still brightening, although without motion of the lips. It was probably the effect of the western sunshine, melting through the thinly diffused vapors that had swept between him and the object that he gazed at. But--as it always did--the aspect of his marvellous friend made Ernest as hopeful as if he had never hoped in vain.\n\n\"Fear not, Ernest,\" said his heart, even as if the Great Face were whispering him,--fear not, Ernest; he will come.\"\n\nMore years sped swiftly and tranquilly away. Ernest still dwelt in his native valley, and was now a man of middle age. By imperceptible degrees, he had become known among the people. Now, as heretofore, he labored for his bread, and was the same simple-hearted man that he had always been. But he had thought and felt so much, he had given so many of the best hours of his life to unworldly hopes for some great good to mankind, that it seemed as though he had been talking with the angels, and had imbibed a portion of their wisdom unawares. It was visible in the calm and well-considered beneficence of his daily life, the quiet stream of which had made a wide green margin all along its course. Not a day passed by, that the world was not the better because this man, humble as he was, had lived. He never stepped aside from his own path, yet would always reach a blessing to his neighbor. Almost involuntarily too, he had become a preacher. The pure and high simplicity of his thought, which, as one of its manifestations, took shape in the good deeds that dropped silently from his hand, flowed also forth in speech. He uttered truths that wrought upon and moulded the lives of those who heard him. His auditors, it may be, never suspected that Ernest, their own neighbor and familiar friend, was more than an ordinary man; least of all did Ernest himself suspect it; but, inevitably as the murmur of a rivulet, came thoughts out of his mouth that no other human lips had spoken.\n\nWhen the people's minds had had a little time to cool, they were ready enough to acknowledge their mistake in imagining a similarity between General Blood-and-Thunder's truculent physiognomy and the benign visage on the mountain-side. But now, again, there were reports and many paragraphs in the newspapers, affirming that the likeness of the Great Stone Face had appeared upon the broad shoulders of a certain eminent statesman. He, like Mr. Gathergold and Old Blood-and-Thunder, was a native of the valley, but had left it in his early days, and taken up the trades of law and politics. Instead of the rich man's wealth and the warrior's sword, he had but a tongue, and it was mightier than both together. So wonderfully eloquent was he, that whatever he might choose to say, his auditors had no choice but to believe him; wrong looked like right, and right like wrong; for when it pleased him, he could make a kind of illuminated fog with his mere breath, and obscure the natural daylight with it. His tongue, indeed, was a magic instrument: sometimes it rumbled like the thunder; sometimes it warbled like the sweetest music. It was the blast of war, the song of peace; and it seemed to have a heart in it, when there was no such matter. In good truth, he was a wondrous man; and when his tongue had acquired him all other imaginable success,--when it had been heard in halls of state, and in the courts of princes and potentates,--after it had made him known all over the world, even as a voice crying from shore to shore,--it finally persuaded his countrymen to select him for the Presidency. Before this time,--indeed, as soon as he began to grow celebrated,--his admirers had found out the resemblance between him and the Great Stone Face; and so much were they struck by it, that throughout the country this distinguished gentleman was known by the name of Old Stony Phiz. The phrase was considered as giving a highly favorable aspect to his political prospects; for, as is likewise the case with the Popedom, nobody ever becomes President without taking a name other than his own.\n\nWhile his friends were doing their best to make him President, Old Stony Phiz, as he was called, set out on a visit to the valley where he was born. Of course, he had no other object than to shake hands with his fellow-citizens and neither thought nor cared about any effect which his progress through the country might have upon the election. Magnificent preparations were made to receive the illustrious statesman; a cavalcade of horsemen set forth to meet him at the boundary line of the State, and all the people left their business and gathered along the wayside to see him pass. Among these was Ernest. Though more than once disappointed, as we have seen, he had such a hopeful and confiding nature, that he was always ready to believe in whatever seemed beautiful and good. He kept his heart continually open, and thus was sure to catch the blessing from on high when it should come. So now again, as buoyantly as ever, he went forth to behold the likeness of the Great Stone Face.\n\nThe cavalcade came prancing along the road, with a great clattering of hoofs and a mighty cloud of dust, which rose up so dense and high that the visage of the mountain-side was completely hidden from Ernest's eyes. All the great men of the neighborhood were there on horseback; militia officers, in uniform; the member of Congress; the sheriff of the county; the editors of newspapers; and many a farmer, too, had mounted his patient steed, with his Sunday coat upon his back. It really was a very brilliant spectacle, especially as there were numerous banners flaunting over the cavalcade, on some of which were gorgeous portraits of the illustrious statesman and the Great Stone Face, smiling familiarly at one another, like two brothers. If the pictures were to be trusted, the mutual resemblance, it must be confessed, was marvellous. We must not forget to mention that there was a band of music, which made the echoes of the mountains ring and reverberate with the loud triumph of its strains; so that airy and soul-thrilling melodies broke out among all the heights and hollows, as if every nook of his native valley had found a voice, to welcome the distinguished guest. But the grandest effect was when the far-off mountain precipice flung back the music; for then the Great Stone Face itself seemed to be swelling the triumphant chorus, in acknowledgment that, at length, the man of prophecy was come.\n\nAll this while the people were throwing up their hats and shouting with enthusiasm so contagious that the heart of Ernest kindled up, and he likewise threw up his hat, and shouted, as loudly as the loudest, \"Huzza for the great man! Huzza for Old Stony Phiz!\" But as yet he had not seen him.\n\n\"Here he is, now!\" cried those who stood near Ernest. \"There! There! Look at Old Stony Phiz and then at the Old Man of the Mountain, and see if they are not as like as two twin-brothers!\"\n\nIn the midst of all this gallant array came an open barouche, drawn by four white horses; and in the barouche, with his massive head uncovered, sat the illustrious statesman, Old Stony Phiz himself.\n\n\"Confess it,\" said one of Ernest's neighbors to him, \"the Great Stone Face has met its match at last!\"\n\nNow, it must be owned that, at his first glimpse of the countenance which was bowing and smiling from the barouche, Ernest did fancy that there was a resemblance between it and the old familiar face upon the mountain-side. The brow, with its massive depth and loftiness, and all the other features, indeed, were boldly and strongly hewn, as if in emulation of a more than heroic, of a Titanic model. But the sublimity and stateliness, the grand expression of a divine sympathy, that illuminated the mountain visage and etherealized its ponderous granite substance into spirit, might here be sought in vain. Something had been originally left out, or had departed. And therefore the marvellously gifted statesman had always a weary gloom in the deep caverns of his eyes, as of a child that has outgrown its playthings or a man of mighty faculties and little aims, whose life, with all its high performances, was vague and empty, because no high purpose had endowed it with reality.\n\nStill, Ernest's neighbor was thrusting his elbow into his side, and pressing him for an answer.\n\n\"Confess! confess! Is not he the very picture of your Old Man of the Mountain?\"\n\n\"No!\" said Ernest bluntly, \"I see little or no likeness.\"\n\n\"Then so much the worse for the Great Stone Face!\" answered his neighbor; and again he set up a shout for Old Stony Phiz.\n\nBut Ernest turned away, melancholy, and almost despondent: for this was the saddest of his disappointments, to behold a man who might have fulfilled the prophecy, and had not willed to do so. Meantime, the cavalcade, the banners, the music, and the barouches swept past him, with the vociferous crowd in the rear, leaving the dust to settle down, and the Great Stone Face to be revealed again, with the grandeur that it had worn for untold centuries.\n\n\"Lo, here I am, Ernest!\" the benign lips seemed to say. \"I have waited longer than thou, and am not yet weary. Fear not; the man will come.\"\n\nThe years hurried onward, treading in their haste on one another's heels. And now they began to bring white hairs, and scatter them over the head of Ernest; they made reverend wrinkles across his forehead, and furrows in his cheeks. He was an aged man. But not in vain had he grown old: more than the white hairs on his head were the sage thoughts in his mind; his wrinkles and furrows were inscriptions that Time had graved, and in which he had written legends of wisdom that had been tested by the tenor of a life. And Ernest had ceased to be obscure. Unsought for, undesired, had come the fame which so many seek, and made him known in the great world, beyond the limits of the valley in which he had dwelt so quietly. College professors, and even the active men of cities, came from far to see and converse with Ernest; for the report had gone abroad that this simple husbandman had ideas unlike those of other men, not gained from books, but of a higher tone,--a tranquil and familiar majesty, as if he had been talking with the angels as his daily friends. Whether it were sage, statesman, or philanthropist, Ernest received these visitors with the gentle sincerity that had characterized him from boyhood, and spoke freely with them of whatever came uppermost, or lay deepest in his heart or their own. While they talked together, his face would kindle, unawares, and shine upon them, as with a mild evening light. Pensive with the fulness of such discourse, his guests took leave and went their way; and passing up the valley, paused to look at the Great Stone Face, imagining that they had seen its likeness in a human countenance, but could not remember where.\n\nWhile Ernest had been growing up and growing old, a bountiful Providence had granted a new poet to this earth. He likewise, was a native of the valley, but had spent the greater part of his life at a distance from that romantic region, pouring out his sweet music amid the bustle and din of cities. Often, however, did the mountains which had been familiar to him in his childhood lift their snowy peaks into the clear atmosphere of his poetry. Neither was the Great Stone Face forgotten, for the poet had celebrated it in an ode, which was grand enough to have been uttered by its own majestic lips. This man of genius, we may say, had come down from heaven with wonderful endowments. If he sang of a mountain, the eyes of all mankind beheld a mightier grandeur reposing on its breast, or soaring to its summit, than had before been seen there. If his theme were a lovely lake, a celestial smile had now been thrown over it, to gleam forever on its surface. If it were the vast old sea, even the deep immensity of its dread bosom seemed to swell the higher, as if moved by the emotions of the song. Thus the world assumed another and a better aspect from the hour that the poet blessed it with his happy eyes. The Creator had bestowed him, as the last best touch to his own handiwork. Creation was not finished till the poet came to interpret, and so complete it.\n\nThe effect was no less high and beautiful, when his human brethren were the subject of his verse. The man or woman, sordid with the common dust of life, who crossed his daily path, and the little child who played in it, were glorified if he beheld them in his mood of poetic faith. He showed the golden links of the great chain that intertwined them with an angelic kindred; he brought out the hidden traits of a celestial birth that made them worthy of such kin. Some, indeed, there were, who thought to show the soundness of their judgment by affirming that all the beauty and dignity of the natural world existed only in the poet's fancy. Let such men speak for themselves, who undoubtedly appear to have been spawned forth by Nature with a contemptuous bitterness; she having plastered them up out of her refuse stuff, after all the swine were made. As respects all things else, the poet's ideal was the truest truth.\n\nThe songs of this poet found their way to Ernest. He read them after his customary toil, seated on the bench before his cottage-door, where for such a length of time he had filled his repose with thought, by gazing at the Great Stone Face. And now as he read stanzas that caused the soul to thrill within him, he lifted his eyes to the vast countenance beaming on him so benignantly.\n\n\"O majestic friend,\" he murmured, addressing the Great Stone Face, \"is not this man worthy to resemble thee?\"\n\nThe Face seemed to smile, but answered not a word.\n\nNow it happened that the poet, though he dwelt so far away, had not only heard of Ernest, but had meditated much upon his character, until he deemed nothing so desirable as to meet this man, whose untaught wisdom walked hand in hand with the noble simplicity of his life. One summer morning, therefore, he took passage by the railroad, and, in the decline of the afternoon, alighted from the cars at no great distance from Ernest's cottage. The great hotel, which had formerly been the palace of Mr. Gathergold, was close at hand, but the poet, with his carpet-bag on his arm, inquired at once where Ernest dwelt, and was resolved to be accepted as his guest.\n\nApproaching the door, he there found the good old man, holding a volume in his hand, which alternately he read, and then, with a finger between the leaves, looked lovingly at the Great Stone Face.\n\n\"Good evening,\" said the poet. \"Can you give a traveller a night's lodging?\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" answered Ernest; and then he added, smiling, \"Methinks I never saw the Great Stone Face look so hospitably at a stranger.\"\n\nThe poet sat down on the bench beside him, and he and Ernest talked together. Often had the poet held intercourse with the wittiest and the wisest, but never before with a man like Ernest, whose thoughts and feelings gushed up with such a natural freedom, and who made great truths so familiar by his simple utterance of them. Angels, as had been so often said, seemed to have wrought with him at his labor in the fields; angels seemed to have sat with him by the fireside; and, dwelling with angels as friend with friends, he had imbibed the sublimity of their ideas, and imbued it with the sweet and lowly charm of household words. So thought the poet. And Ernest, on the other hand, was moved and agitated by the living images which the poet flung out of his mind, and which peopled all the air about the cottage-door with shapes of beauty, both gay and pensive. The sympathies of these two men instructed them with a profounder sense than either could have attained alone. Their minds accorded into one strain, and made delightful music which neither of them could have claimed as all his own, nor distinguished his own share from the other's. They led one another, as it were, into a high pavilion of their thoughts, so remote, and hitherto so dim, that they had never entered it before, and so beautiful that they desired to be there always.\n\nAs Ernest listened to the poet, he imagined that the Great Stone Face was bending forward to listen too. He gazed earnestly into the poet's glowing eyes.\n\n\"Who are you, my strangely gifted guest?\" he said.\n\nThe poet laid his finger on the volume that Ernest had been reading.\n\n\"You have read these poems,\" said he. \"You know me, then,--for I wrote them.\"\n\nAgain, and still more earnestly than before, Ernest examined the poet's features; then turned towards the Great Stone Face; then back, with an uncertain aspect, to his guest. But his countenance fell; he shook his head, and sighed.\n\n\"Wherefore are you sad?\" inquired the poet.\n\n\"Because,\" replied Ernest, \"all through life I have awaited the fulfilment of a prophecy; and, when I read these poems, I hoped that it might be fulfilled in you.\"\n\n\"You hoped,\" answered the poet, faintly smiling, \"to find in me the likeness of the Great Stone Face. And you are disappointed, as formerly with Mr. Gathergold, and Old Blood-and-Thunder, and Old Stony Phiz. Yes, Ernest, it is my doom. You must add my name to the illustrious three, and record another failure of your hopes. For--in shame and sadness do I speak it, Ernest--I am not worthy to be typified by yonder benign and majestic image.\"\n\n\"And why?\" asked Ernest. He pointed to the volume. \"Are not those thoughts divine?\"\n\n\"They have a strain of the Divinity,\" replied the poet. \"You can hear in them the far-off echo of a heavenly song. But my life, dear Ernest, has not corresponded with my thought. I have had grand dreams, but they have been only dreams, because I have lived--and that, too, by my own choice--among poor and mean realities. Sometimes even--shall I dare to say it?--I lack faith in the grandeur, the beauty, and the goodness, which my own words are said to have made more evident in nature and in human life. Why, then, pure seeker of the good and true, shouldst thou hope to find me, in yonder image of the divine?\"\n\nThe poet spoke sadly, and his eyes were dim with tears. So, likewise, were those of Ernest.\n\nAt the hour of sunset, as had long been his frequent custom, Ernest was to discourse to an assemblage of the neighboring inhabitants in the open air. He and the poet, arm in arm, still talking together as they went along, proceeded to the spot. It was a small nook among the hills, with a gray precipice behind, the stern front of which was relieved by the pleasant foliage of many creeping plants that made a tapestry for the naked rock, by hanging their festoons from all its rugged angles. At a small elevation above the ground, set in a rich framework of verdure, there appeared a niche, spacious enough to admit a human figure, with freedom for such gestures as spontaneously accompany earnest thought and genuine emotion. Into this natural pulpit Ernest ascended, and threw a look of familiar kindness around upon his audience. They stood, or sat, or reclined upon the grass, as seemed good to each, with the departing sunshine falling obliquely over them, and mingling its subdued cheerfulness with the solemnity of a grove of ancient trees, beneath and amid the boughs of which the golden rays were constrained to pass. In another direction was seen the Great Stone Face, with the same cheer, combined with the same solemnity, in its benignant aspect.\n\nErnest began to speak, giving to the people of what was in his heart and mind. His words had power, because they accorded with his thoughts; and his thoughts had reality and depth, because they harmonized with the life which he had always lived. It was not mere breath that this preacher uttered; they were the words of life, because a life of good deeds and holy love was melted into them. Pearls, pure and rich, had been dissolved into this precious draught. The poet, as he listened, felt that the being and character of Ernest were a nobler strain of poetry than he had ever written. His eyes glistening with tears, he gazed reverentially at the venerable man, and said within himself that never was there an aspect so worthy of a prophet and a sage as that mild, sweet, thoughtful countenance, with the glory of white hair diffused about it. At a distance, but distinctly to be seen, high up in the golden light of the setting sun, appeared the Great Stone Face, with hoary mists around it, like the white hairs around the brow of Ernest. Its look of grand beneficence seemed to embrace the world.\n\nAt that moment, in sympathy with a thought which he was about to utter, the face of Ernest assumed a grandeur of expression, so imbued with benevolence, that the poet, by an irresistible impulse, threw his arms aloft and shouted,\"Behold! Behold! Ernest is himself the likeness of the Great Stone Face!\"\n\nThen all the people looked, and saw that what the deep-sighted poet said was true. The prophecy was fulfilled. But Ernest, having finished what he had to say, took the poet's arm, and walked slowly homeward, still hoping that some wiser and better man than himself would by and by appear, bearing a resemblance to the GREAT STONE FACE.",

    "content": "All day long the little boy worked hard, in field\nand barn and shed, for his people were poor farmers, and could not pay a workman; but at sunset there came an hour that was all his own, for his father had given it to him. Then the boy would go up to the top of a hill and look across at another hill that rose some miles away. On this far hill stood a house with windows of clear gold and diamonds. They shone and blazed so that it made the boy wink to look at them: but after a while the people in the house put up shutters, as it seemed, and then it looked like any common farmhouse. The boy supposed they did this because it was supper-time; and then he would go into the house and have his supper of bread and milk, and so to bed.\n\nOne day the boy’s father called him and said: “You have been a good boy, and have earned a holiday. Take this day for your own; but remember that God gave it, and try to learn some good thing.”\n\nThe boy thanked his father and kissed his mother; then he put a piece of bread in his pocket, and started off to find the house with the golden windows.\n\nIt was pleasant walking. His bare feet made marks in the white dust, and when he looked back, the footprints seemed to be following him, and making company for him. His shadow, too, kept beside him, and would dance or run with him as he pleased; so it was very cheerful.\n\nBy and by he felt hungry; and he sat down by a brown brook that ran through the alder hedge by the roadside, and ate his bread, and drank the clear water. Then he scattered the crumbs for the birds, as his mother had taught him to do, and went on his way.\n\nAfter a long time he came to a high green hill; and when he had climbed the hill, there was the house on the top; but it seemed that the shutters were up, for he could not see the golden windows. He came up to the house, and then he could well have wept, for the windows were of clear glass, like any others, and there was no gold anywhere about them.\n\nA woman came to the door, and looked kindly at the boy, and asked him what he wanted.\n\n“I saw the golden windows from our hilltop,” he said, “and I came to see them, but now they are only glass.”\n\nThe woman shook her head and laughed.\n\n“We are poor farming people,” she said, “and are not likely to have gold about our windows; but glass is better to see through.”\n\nShe bade the boy sit down on the broad stone step at the door, and brought him a cup of milk and a cake, and bade him rest; then she called her daughter, a child of his own age, and nodded kindly at the two, and went back to her work.\n\nThe little girl was barefooted like himself, and wore a brown cotton gown, but her hair was golden like the windows he had seen, and her eyes were blue like the sky at noon. She led the boy about the farm, and showed him her black calf with the white star on its forehead, and he told her about his own at home, which was red like a chestnut, with four white feet. Then when they had eaten an apple together, and so had become friends, the boy asked her about the golden windows. The little girl nodded, and said she knew all about them, only he had mistaken the house.\n\n“You have come quite the wrong way!” she said. “Come with me, and I will show you the house with the golden windows, and then you will see for yourself.”\n\nThey went to a knoll that rose behind the farmhouse, and as they went the little girl told him that the golden windows could only be seen at a certain hour, about sunset.\n\n“Yes, I know that!” said the boy.\n\nWhen they reached the top of the knoll, the girl turned and pointed; and there on[9] a hill far away stood a house with windows of clear gold and diamond, just as he had seen them. And when they looked again, the boy saw that it was his own home.\n\nThen he told the little girl that he must go; and he gave her his best pebble, the white one with the red band, that he had carried for a year in his pocket; and she gave him three horse-chestnuts, one red like satin, one spotted, and one white like milk. He kissed her, and promised to come again, but he did not tell her what he had learned; and so he went back down the hill, and the little girl stood in the sunset light and watched him.\n\nThe way home was long, and it was dark before the boy reached his father’s house; but the lamplight and firelight shone through the windows, making them almost as bright as he had seen them from the hilltop; and when he opened the door, his mother came to kiss him, and his little sister ran to throw her arms about his neck, and his father looked up and smiled from his seat by the fire.\n\n“Have you had a good day?” asked his mother.\n\nYes, the boy had had a very good day.\n\n“And have you learned anything?” asked his father.\n\n“Yes!” said the boy. “I have learned that our house has windows of gold and diamond.”",

    "content": "Far out in the ocean the water is as blue as the petals of the loveliest cornflower, and as clear as the purest glass. But it is very deep too. It goes down deeper than any anchor rope will go, and many, many steeples would have to be stacked one on top of another to reach from the bottom to the surface of the sea. It is down there that the sea folk live.\n\nNow don't suppose that there are only bare white sands at the bottom of the sea. No indeed! The most marvelous trees and flowers grow down there, with such pliant stalks and leaves that the least stir in the water makes them move about as though they were alive. All sorts of fish, large and small, dart among the branches, just as birds flit through the trees up here. From the deepest spot in the ocean rises the palace of the sea king. Its walls are made of coral and its high pointed windows of the clearest amber, but the roof is made of mussel shells that open and shut with the tide. This is a wonderful sight to see, for every shell holds glistening pearls, any one of which would be the pride of a queen's crown.\n\nThe sea king down there had been a widower for years, and his old mother kept house for him. She was a clever woman, but very proud of her noble birth. Therefore she flaunted twelve oysters on her tail while the other ladies of the court were only allowed to wear six. Except for this she was an altogether praiseworthy person, particularly so because she was extremely fond of her granddaughters, the little sea princesses. They were six lovely girls, but the youngest was the most beautiful of them all. Her skin was as soft and tender as a rose petal, and her eyes were as blue as the deep sea, but like all the others she had no feet. Her body ended in a fish tail.\n\nThe whole day long they used to play in the palace, down in the great halls where live flowers grew on the walls. Whenever the high amber windows were thrown open the fish would swim in, just as swallows dart into our rooms when we open the windows. But these fish, now, would swim right up to the little princesses to eat out of their hands and let themselves be petted.\n\nOutside the palace was a big garden, with flaming red and deep-blue trees. Their fruit glittered like gold, and their blossoms flamed like fire on their constantly waving stalks. The soil was very fine sand indeed, but as blue as burning brimstone. A strange blue veil lay over everything down there. You would have thought yourself aloft in the air with only the blue sky above and beneath you, rather than down at the bottom of the sea. When there was a dead calm, you could just see the sun, like a scarlet flower with light streaming from its calyx.\n\nEach little princess had her own small garden plot, where she could dig and plant whatever she liked. One of them made her little flower bed in the shape of a whale, another thought it neater to shape hers like a little mermaid, but the youngest of them made hers as round as the sun, and there she grew only flowers which were as red as the sun itself. She was an unusual child, quiet and wistful, and when her sisters decorated their gardens with all kinds of odd things they had found in sunken ships, she would allow nothing in hers except flowers as red as the sun, and a pretty marble statue. This figure of a handsome boy, carved in pure white marble, had sunk down to the bottom of the sea from some ship that was wrecked. Beside the statue she planted a rose-colored weeping willow tree, which thrived so well that its graceful branches shaded the statue and hung down to the blue sand, where their shadows took on a violet tint, and swayed as the branches swayed. It looked as if the roots and the tips of the branches were kissing each other in play.\n\nNothing gave the youngest princess such pleasure as to hear about the world of human beings up above them. Her old grandmother had to tell her all she knew about ships and cities, and of people and animals. What seemed nicest of all to her was that up on land the flowers were fragrant, for those at the bottom of the sea had no scent. And she thought it was nice that the woods were green, and that the fish you saw among their branches could sing so loud and sweet that it was delightful to hear them. Her grandmother had to call the little birds \"fish,\" or the princess would not have known what she was talking about, for she had never seen a bird.\n\n\"When you get to be fifteen,\" her grandmother said, \"you will be allowed to rise up out of the ocean and sit on the rocks in the moonlight, to watch the great ships sailing by. You will see woods and towns, too.\"\n\nNext year one of her sisters would be fifteen, but the others - well, since each was a whole year older than the next the youngest still had five long years to wait until she could rise up from the water and see what our world was like. But each sister promised to tell the others about all that she saw, and what she found most marvelous on her first day. Their grandmother had not told them half enough, and there were so many thing that they longed to know about.\n\nThe most eager of them all was the youngest, the very one who was so quiet and wistful. Many a night she stood by her open window and looked up through the dark blue water where the fish waved their fins and tails. She could just see the moon and stars. To be sure, their light was quite dim, but looked at through the water they seemed much bigger than they appear to us. Whenever a cloud-like shadow swept across them, she knew that it was either a whale swimming overhead, or a ship with many human beings aboard it. Little did they dream that a pretty young mermaid was down below, stretching her white arms up toward the keel of their ship.\n\nThe eldest princess had her fifteenth birthday, so now she received permission to rise up out of the water. When she got back she had a hundred things to tell her sisters about, but the most marvelous thing of all, she said, was to lie on a sand bar in the moonlight, when the sea was calm, and to gaze at the large city on the shore, where the lights twinkled like hundreds of stars; to listen to music; to hear the chatter and clamor of carriages and people; to see so many church towers and spires; and to hear the ringing bells. Because she could not enter the city, that was just what she most dearly longed to do.\n\nOh, how intently the youngest sister listened. After this, whenever she stood at her open window at night and looked up through the dark blue waters, she thought of that great city with all of its clatter and clamor, and even fancied that in these depths she could hear the church bells ring.\n\nThe next year, her second sister had permission to rise up to the surface and swim wherever she pleased. She came up just at sunset, and she said that this spectacle was the most marvelous sight she had ever seen. The heavens had a golden glow, and as for the clouds - she could not find words to describe their beauty. Splashed with red and tinted with violet, they sailed over her head. But much faster than the sailing clouds were wild swans in a flock. Like a long white veil trailing above the sea, they flew toward the setting sun. She too swam toward it, but down it went, and all the rose-colored glow faded from the sea and sky.\n\nThe following year, her third sister ascended, and as she was the boldest of them all she swam up a broad river that flowed into the ocean. She saw gloriously green, vine-colored hills. Palaces and manor houses could be glimpsed through the splendid woods. She heard all the birds sing, and the sun shone so brightly that often she had to dive under the water to cool her burning face. In a small cove she found a whole school of mortal children, paddling about in the water quite naked. She wanted to play with them, but they took fright and ran away. Then along came a little black animal - it was a dog, but she had never seen a dog before. It barked at her so ferociously that she took fright herself, and fled to the open sea. But never could she forget the splendid woods, the green hills, and the nice children who could swim in the water although they didn't wear fish tails.\n\nThe fourth sister was not so venturesome. She stayed far out among the rough waves, which she said was a marvelous place. You could see all around you for miles and miles, and the heavens up above you were like a vast dome of glass. She had seen ships, but they were so far away that they looked like sea gulls. Playful dolphins had turned somersaults, and monstrous whales had spouted water through their nostrils so that it looked as if hundreds of fountains were playing all around them.\n\nNow the fifth sister had her turn. Her birthday came in the wintertime, so she saw things that none of the others had seen. The sea was a deep green color, and enormous icebergs drifted about. Each one glistened like a pearl, she said, but they were more lofty than any church steeple built by man. They assumed the most fantastic shapes, and sparkled like diamonds. She had seated herself on the largest one, and all the ships that came sailing by sped away as soon as the frightened sailors saw her there with her long hair blowing in the wind.\n\nIn the late evening clouds filled the sky. Thunder cracked and lightning darted across the heavens. Black waves lifted those great bergs of ice on high, where they flashed when the lightning struck.\n\nOn all the ships the sails were reefed and there was fear and trembling. But quietly she sat there, upon her drifting iceberg, and watched the blue forked lightning strike the sea.\n\nEach of the sisters took delight in the lovely new sights when she first rose up to the surface of the sea. But when they became grown-up girls, who were allowed to go wherever they liked, they became indifferent to it. They would become homesick, and in a month they said that there was no place like the bottom of the sea, where they felt so completely at home.\n\nOn many an evening the older sisters would rise to the surface, arm in arm, all five in a row. They had beautiful voices, more charming than those of any mortal beings. When a storm was brewing, and they anticipated a shipwreck, they would swim before the ship and sing most seductively of how beautiful it was at the bottom of the ocean, trying to overcome the prejudice that the sailors had against coming down to them. But people could not understand their song, and mistook it for the voice of the storm. Nor was it for them to see the glories of the deep. When their ship went down they were drowned, and it was as dead men that they reached the sea king's palace.\n\nOn the evenings when the mermaids rose through the water like this, arm in arm, their youngest sister stayed behind all alone, looking after them and wanting to weep. But a mermaid has no tears, and therefore she suffers so much more.\n\n\"Oh, how I do wish I were fifteen!\" she said. \"I know I shall love that world up there and all the people who live in it.\"\n\nAnd at last she too came to be fifteen.\n\n\"Now I'll have you off my hands,\" said her grandmother, the old queen dowager. \"Come, let me adorn you like your sisters.\" In the little maid's hair she put a wreath of white lilies, each petal of which was formed from half of a pearl. And the old queen let eight big oysters fasten themselves to the princess's tail, as a sign of her high rank.\n\n\"But that hurts!\" said the little mermaid.\n\n\"You must put up with a good deal to keep up appearances,\" her grandmother told her.\n\nOh, how gladly she would have shaken off all these decorations, and laid aside the cumbersome wreath! The red flowers in her garden were much more becoming to her, but she didn't dare to make any changes. \"Good-by,\" she said, and up she went through the water, as light and as sparkling as a bubble.\n\nThe sun had just gone down when her head rose above the surface, but the clouds still shone like gold and roses, and in the delicately tinted sky sparkled the clear gleam of the evening star. The air was mild and fresh and the sea unruffled. A great three-master lay in view with only one of all its sails set, for there was not even the whisper of a breeze, and the sailors idled about in the rigging and on the yards. There was music and singing on the ship, and as night came on they lighted hundreds of such brightly colored lanterns that one might have thought the flags of all nations were swinging in the air.\n\nThe little mermaid swam right up to the window of the main cabin, and each time she rose with the swell she could peep in through the clear glass panes at the crowd of brilliantly dressed people within. The handsomest of them all was a young Prince with big dark eyes. He could not be more than sixteen years old. It was his birthday and that was the reason for all the celebration. Up on deck the sailors were dancing, and when the Prince appeared among them a hundred or more rockets flew through the air, making it as bright as day. These startled the little mermaid so badly that she ducked under the water. But she soon peeped up again, and then it seemed as if all the stars in the sky were falling around her. Never had she seen such fireworks. Great suns spun around, splendid fire-fish floated through the blue air, and all these things were mirrored in the crystal clear sea. It was so brilliantly bright that you could see every little rope of the ship, and the people could be seen distinctly. Oh, how handsome the young Prince was! He laughed, and he smiled and shook people by the hand, while the music rang out in the perfect evening.\n\nIt got very late, but the little mermaid could not take her eyes off the ship and the handsome Prince. The brightly colored lanterns were put out, no more rockets flew through the air, and no more cannon boomed. But there was a mutter and rumble deep down in the sea, and the swell kept bouncing her up so high that she could look into the cabin.\n\nNow the ship began to sail. Canvas after canvas was spread in the wind, the waves rose high, great clouds gathered, and lightning flashed in the distance. Ah, they were in for a terrible storm, and the mariners made haste to reef the sails. The tall ship pitched and rolled as it sped through the angry sea. The waves rose up like towering black mountains, as if they would break over the masthead, but the swan-like ship plunged into the valleys between such waves, and emerged to ride their lofty heights. To the little mermaid this seemed good sport, but to the sailors it was nothing of the sort. The ship creaked and labored, thick timbers gave way under the heavy blows, waves broke over the ship, the mainmast snapped in two like a reed, the ship listed over on its side, and water burst into the hold.\n\nThe Little Mermaid rescues the princeNow the little mermaid saw that people were in peril, and that she herself must take care to avoid the beams and wreckage tossed about by the sea. One moment it would be black as pitch, and she couldn't see a thing. Next moment the lightning would flash so brightly that she could distinguish every soul on board. Everyone was looking out for himself as best he could. She watched closely for the young Prince, and when the ship split in two she saw him sink down in the sea. At first she was overjoyed that he would be with her, but then she recalled that human people could not live under the water, and he could only visit her father's palace as a dead man. No, he should not die! So she swam in among all the floating planks and beams, completely forgetting that they might crush her. She dived through the waves and rode their crests, until at length she reached the young Prince, who was no longer able to swim in that raging sea. His arms and legs were exhausted, his beautiful eyes were closing, and he would have died if the little mermaid had not come to help him. She held his head above water, and let the waves take them wherever the waves went.\n\nAt daybreak, when the storm was over, not a trace of the ship was in view. The sun rose out of the waters, red and bright, and its beams seemed to bring the glow of life back to the cheeks of the Prince, but his eyes remained closed. The mermaid kissed his high and shapely forehead. As she stroked his wet hair in place, it seemed to her that he looked like that marble statue in her little garden. She kissed him again and hoped that he would live.\n\nShe saw dry land rise before her in high blue mountains, topped with snow as glistening white as if a flock of swans were resting there. Down by the shore were splendid green woods, and in the foreground stood a church, or perhaps a convent; she didn't know which, but anyway it was a building. Orange and lemon trees grew in its garden, and tall palm trees grew beside the gateway. Here the sea formed a little harbor, quite calm and very deep. Fine white sand had been washed up below the cliffs. She swam there with the handsome Prince, and stretched him out on the sand, taking special care to pillow his head up high in the warm sunlight.\n\nThe bells began to ring in the great white building, and a number of young girls came out into the garden. The little mermaid swam away behind some tall rocks that stuck out of the water. She covered her hair and her shoulders with foam so that no one could see her tiny face, and then she watched to see who would find the poor Prince.\n\nIn a little while one of the young girls came upon him. She seemed frightened, but only for a minute; then she called more people. The mermaid watched the Prince regain consciousness, and smile at everyone around him. But he did not smile at her, for he did not even know that she had saved him. She felt very unhappy, and when they led him away to the big building she dived sadly down into the water and returned to her father's palace.\n\nShe had always been quiet and wistful, and now she became much more so. Her sisters asked her what she had seen on her first visit up to the surface, but she would not tell them a thing.\n\nMany evenings and many mornings she revisited the spot where she had left the Prince. She saw the fruit in the garden ripened and harvested, and she saw the snow on the high mountain melted away, but she did not see the Prince, so each time she came home sadder than she had left. It was her one consolation to sit in her little garden and throw her arms about the beautiful marble statue that looked so much like the Prince. But she took no care of her flowers now. They overgrew the paths until the place was a wilderness, and their long stalks and leaves became so entangled in the branches of the tree that it cast a gloomy shade.\n\nFinally she couldn't bear it any longer. She told her secret to one of her sisters. Immediately all the other sisters heard about it. No one else knew, except a few more mermaids who told no one - except their most intimate friends. One of these friends knew who the Prince was. She too had seen the birthday celebration on the ship. She knew where he came from and where his kingdom was.\n\n\"Come, little sister!\" said the other princesses. Arm in arm, they rose from the water in a long row, right in front of where they knew the Prince's palace stood. It was built of pale, glistening, golden stone with great marble staircases, one of which led down to the sea. Magnificent gilt domes rose above the roof, and between the pillars all around the building were marble statues that looked most lifelike. Through the clear glass of the lofty windows one could see into the splendid halls, with their costly silk hangings and tapestries, and walls covered with paintings that were delightful to behold. In the center of the main hall a large fountain played its columns of spray up to the glass-domed roof, through which the sun shone down on the water and upon the lovely plants that grew in the big basin.\n\nNow that she knew where he lived, many an evening and many a night she spent there in the sea. She swam much closer to shore than any of her sisters would dare venture, and she even went far up a narrow stream, under the splendid marble balcony that cast its long shadow in the water. Here she used to sit and watch the young Prince when he thought himself quite alone in the bright moonlight.\n\nOn many evenings she saw him sail out in his fine boat, with music playing and flags a-flutter. She would peep out through the green rushes, and if the wind blew her long silver veil, anyone who saw it mistook it for a swan spreading its wings.\n\nOn many nights she saw the fishermen come out to sea with their torches, and heard them tell about how kind the young Prince was. This made her proud to think that it was she who had saved his life when he was buffeted about, half dead among the waves. And she thought of how softly his head had rested on her breast, and how tenderly she had kissed him, though he knew nothing of all this nor could he even dream of it.\n\nIncreasingly she grew to like human beings, and more and more she longed to live among them. Their world seemed so much wider than her own, for they could skim over the sea in ships, and mount up into the lofty peaks high over the clouds, and their lands stretched out in woods and fields farther than the eye could see. There was so much she wanted to know. Her sisters could not answer all her questions, so she asked her old grandmother, who knew about the \"upper world,\" which was what she said was the right name for the countries above the sea.\n\n\"If men aren't drowned,\" the little mermaid asked, \"do they live on forever? Don't they die, as we do down here in the sea?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the old lady said, \"they too must die, and their lifetimes are even shorter than ours. We can live to be three hundred years old, but when we perish we turn into mere foam on the sea, and haven't even a grave down here among our dear ones. We have no immortal soul, no life hereafter. We are like the green seaweed - once cut down, it never grows again. Human beings, on the contrary, have a soul which lives forever, long after their bodies have turned to clay. It rises through thin air, up to the shining stars. Just as we rise through the water to see the lands on earth, so men rise up to beautiful places unknown, which we shall never see.\"\n\n\"Why weren't we given an immortal soul?\" the little mermaid sadly asked. \"I would gladly give up my three hundred years if I could be a human being only for a day, and later share in that heavenly realm.\"\n\n\"You must not think about that,\" said the old lady. \"We fare much more happily and are much better off than the folk up there.\"\n\n\"Then I must also die and float as foam upon the sea, not hearing the music of the waves, and seeing neither the beautiful flowers nor the red sun! Can't I do anything at all to win an immortal soul?\"\n\n\"No,\" her grandmother answered, \"not unless a human being loved you so much that you meant more to him than his father and mother. If his every thought and his whole heart cleaved to you so that he would let a priest join his right hand to yours and would promise to be faithful here and throughout all eternity, then his soul would dwell in your body, and you would share in the happiness of mankind. He would give you a soul and yet keep his own. But that can never come to pass. The very thing that is your greatest beauty here in the sea - your fish tail - would be considered ugly on land. They have such poor taste that to be thought beautiful there you have to have two awkward props which they call legs.\"\n\nThe little mermaid sighed and looked unhappily at her fish tail.\n\n\"Come, let us be gay!\" the old lady said. \"Let us leap and bound throughout the three hundred years that we have to live. Surely that is time and to spare, and afterwards we shall be glad enough to rest in our graves. - We are holding a court ball this evening.\"\n\nThis was a much more glorious affair than is ever to be seen on earth. The walls and the ceiling of the great ballroom were made of massive but transparent glass. Many hundreds of huge rose-red and grass-green shells stood on each side in rows, with the blue flames that burned in each shell illuminating the whole room and shining through the walls so clearly that it was quite bright in the sea outside. You could see the countless fish, great and small, swimming toward the glass walls. On some of them the scales gleamed purplish-red, while others were silver and gold. Across the floor of the hall ran a wide stream of water, and upon this the mermaids and mermen danced to their own entrancing songs. Such beautiful voices are not to be heard among the people who live on land. The little mermaid sang more sweetly than anyone else, and everyone applauded her. For a moment her heart was happy, because she knew she had the loveliest voice of all, in the sea or on the land. But her thoughts soon strayed to the world up above. She could not forget the charming Prince, nor her sorrow that she did not have an immortal soul like his. Therefore she stole out of her father's palace and, while everything there was song and gladness, she sat sadly in her own little garden.\n\nThen she heard a bugle call through the water, and she thought, \"That must mean he is sailing up there, he whom I love more than my father or mother, he of whom I am always thinking, and in whose hands I would so willingly trust my lifelong happiness. I dare do anything to win him and to gain an immortal soul. While my sisters are dancing here, in my father's palace, I shall visit the sea witch of whom I have always been so afraid. Perhaps she will be able to advise me and help me.\"\n\nThe little mermaid set out from her garden toward the whirlpools that raged in front of the witch's dwelling. She had never gone that way before. No flowers grew there, nor any seaweed. Bare and gray, the sands extended to the whirlpools, where like roaring mill wheels the waters whirled and snatched everything within their reach down to the bottom of the sea. Between these tumultuous whirlpools she had to thread her way to reach the witch's waters, and then for a long stretch the only trail lay through a hot seething mire, which the witch called her peat marsh. Beyond it her house lay in the middle of a weird forest, where all the trees and shrubs were polyps, half animal and half plant. They looked like hundred-headed snakes growing out of the soil. All their branches were long, slimy arms, with fingers like wriggling worms. They squirmed, joint by joint, from their roots to their outermost tentacles, and whatever they could lay hold of they twined around and never let go. The little mermaid was terrified, and stopped at the edge of the forest. Her heart thumped with fear and she nearly turned back, but then she remembered the Prince and the souls that men have, and she summoned her courage. She bound her long flowing locks closely about her head so that the polyps could not catch hold of them, folded her arms across her breast, and darted through the water like a fish, in among the slimy polyps that stretched out their writhing arms and fingers to seize her. She saw that every one of them held something that it had caught with its hundreds of little tentacles, and to which it clung as with strong hoops of steel. The white bones of men who had perished at sea and sunk to these depths could be seen in the polyps' arms. Ships' rudders, and seamen's chests, and the skeletons of land animals had also fallen into their clutches, but the most ghastly sight of all was a little mermaid whom they had caught and strangled.\n\nShe reached a large muddy clearing in the forest, where big fat water snakes slithered about, showing their foul yellowish bellies. In the middle of this clearing was a house built of the bones of shipwrecked men, and there sat the sea witch, letting a toad eat out of her mouth just as we might feed sugar to a little canary bird. She called the ugly fat water snakes her little chickabiddies, and let them crawl and sprawl about on her spongy bosom.\n\n\"I know exactly what you want,\" said the sea witch. \"It is very foolish of you, but just the same you shall have your way, for it will bring you to grief, my proud princess. You want to get rid of your fish tail and have two props instead, so that you can walk about like a human creature, and have the young Prince fall in love with you, and win him and an immortal soul besides.\" At this, the witch gave such a loud cackling laugh that the toad and the snakes were shaken to the ground, where they lay writhing.\n\n\"You are just in time,\" said the witch. \"After the sun comes up tomorrow, a whole year would have to go by before I could be of any help to you. J shall compound you a draught, and before sunrise you must swim to the shore with it, seat yourself on dry land, and drink the draught down. Then your tail will divide and shrink until it becomes what the people on earth call a pair of shapely legs. But it will hurt; it will feel as if a sharp sword slashed through you. Everyone who sees you will say that you are the most graceful human being they have ever laid eyes on, for you will keep your gliding movement and no dancer will be able to tread as lightly as you. But every step you take will feel as if you were treading upon knife blades so sharp that blood must flow. I am willing to help you, but are you willing to suffer all this?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the little mermaid said in a trembling voice, as she thought of the Prince and of gaining a human soul.\n\n\"Remember!\" said the witch. \"Once you have taken a human form, you can never be a mermaid again. You can never come back through the waters to your sisters, or to your father's palace. And if you do not win the love of the Prince so completely that for your sake he forgets his father and mother, cleaves to you with his every thought and his whole heart, and lets the priest join your hands in marriage, then you will win no immortal soul. If he marries someone else, your heart will break on the very next morning, and you will become foam of the sea.\"\n\n\"I shall take that risk,\" said the little mermaid, but she turned as pale as death.\n\n\"Also, you will have to pay me,\" said the witch, \"and it is no trifling price that I'm asking. You have the sweetest voice of anyone down here at the bottom of the sea, and while I don't doubt that you would like to captivate the Prince with it, you must give this voice to me. I will take the very best thing that you have, in return for my sovereign draught. I must pour my own blood in it to make the drink as sharp as a two-edged sword.\"\n\n\"But if you take my voice,\" said the little mermaid, \"what will be left to me?\"\n\n\"Your lovely form,\" the witch told her, \"your gliding movements, and your eloquent eyes. With these you can easily enchant a human heart. Well, have you lost your courage? Stick out your little tongue and I shall cut it off. I'll have my price, and you shall have the potent draught.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" said the little mermaid.\n\nThe witch hung her caldron over the flames, to brew the draught. \"Cleanliness is a good thing,\" she said, as she tied her snakes in a knot and scoured out the pot with them. Then she pricked herself in the chest and let her black blood splash into the caldron. Steam swirled up from it, in such ghastly shapes that anyone would have been terrified by them. The witch constantly threw new ingredients into the caldron, and it started to boil with a sound like that of a crocodile shedding tears. When the draught was ready at last, it looked as clear as the purest water.\n\n\"There's your draught,\" said the witch. And she cut off the tongue of the little mermaid, who now was dumb and could neither sing nor talk.\n\n\"If the polyps should pounce on you when you walk back through my wood,\" the witch said, \"just spill a drop of this brew upon them and their tentacles will break in a thousand pieces.\" But there was no need of that, for the polyps curled up in terror as soon as they saw the bright draught. It glittered in the little mermaid's hand as if it were a shining star. So she soon traversed the forest, the marsh, and the place of raging whirlpools.\n\nShe could see her father's palace. The lights had been snuffed out in the great ballroom, and doubtless everyone in the palace was asleep, but she dared not go near them, now that she was stricken dumb and was leaving her home forever. Her heart felt as if it would break with grief. She tip-toed into the garden, took one flower from each of her sisters' little plots, blew a thousand kisses toward the palace, and then mounted up through the dark blue sea.\n\nThe sun had not yet risen when she saw the Prince's palace. As she climbed his splendid marble staircase, the moon was shining clear. The little mermaid swallowed the bitter, fiery draught, and it was as if a two-edged sword struck through her frail body. She swooned away, and lay there as if she were dead. When the sun rose over the sea she awoke and felt a flash of pain, but directly in front of her stood the handsome young Prince, gazing at her with his coal-black eyes. Lowering her gaze, she saw that her fish tail was gone, and that she had the loveliest pair of white legs any young maid could hope to have. But she was naked, so she clothed herself in her own long hair.\n\nThe Prince asked who she was, and how she came to be there. Her deep blue eyes looked at him tenderly but very sadly, for she could not speak. Then he took her hand and led her into his palace. Every footstep felt as if she were walking on the blades and points of sharp knives, just as the witch had foretold, but she gladly endured it. She moved as lightly as a bubble as she walked beside the Prince. He and all who saw her marveled at the grace of her gliding walk.\n\nOnce clad in the rich silk and muslin garments that were provided for her, she was the loveliest person in all the palace, though she was dumb and could neither sing nor speak. Beautiful slaves, attired in silk and cloth of gold, came to sing before the Prince and his royal parents. One of them sang more sweetly than all the others, and when the Prince smiled at her and clapped his hands, the little mermaid felt very unhappy, for she knew that she herself used to sing much more sweetly.\n\n\"Oh,\" she thought, \"if he only knew that I parted with my voice forever so that I could be near him.\"\n\nGraceful slaves now began to dance to the most wonderful music. Then the little mermaid lifted her shapely white arms, rose up on the tips of her toes, and skimmed over the floor. No one had ever danced so well. Each movement set off her beauty to better and better advantage, and her eyes spoke more directly to the heart than any of the singing slaves could do.\n\nShe charmed everyone, and especially the Prince, who called her his dear little foundling. She danced time and again, though every time she touched the floor she felt as if she were treading on sharp-edged steel. The Prince said he would keep her with him always, and that she was to have a velvet pillow to sleep on outside his door.\n\nHe had a page's suit made for her, so that she could go with him on horseback. They would ride through the sweet scented woods, where the green boughs brushed her shoulders, and where the little birds sang among the fluttering leaves.\n\nShe climbed up high mountains with the Prince, and though her tender feet bled so that all could see it, she only laughed and followed him on until they could see the clouds driving far below, like a flock of birds in flight to distant lands.\n\nAt home in the Prince's palace, while the others slept at night, she would go down the broad marble steps to cool her burning feet in the cold sea water, and then she would recall those who lived beneath the sea. One night her sisters came by, arm in arm, singing sadly as they breasted the waves. When she held out her hands toward them, they knew who she was, and told her how unhappy she had made them all. They came to see her every night after that, and once far, far out to sea, she saw her old grandmother, who had not been up to the surface this many a year. With her was the sea king, with his crown upon his head. They stretched out their hands to her, but they did not venture so near the land as her sisters had.\n\nDay after day she became more dear to the Prince, who loved her as one would love a good little child, but he never thought of making her his Queen. Yet she had to be his wife or she would never have an immortal soul, and on the morning after his wedding she would turn into foam on the waves.\n\n\"Don't you love me best of all?\" the little mermaid's eyes seemed to question him, when he took her in his arms and kissed her lovely forehead.\n\n\"Yes, you are most dear to me,\" said the Prince, \"for you have the kindest heart. You love me more than anyone else does, and you look so much like a young girl I once saw but never shall find again. I was on a ship that was wrecked, and the waves cast me ashore near a holy temple, where many young girls performed the rituals. The youngest of them found me beside the sea and saved my life. Though I saw her no more than twice, she is the only person in all the world whom I could love. But you are so much like her that you almost replace the memory of her in my heart. She belongs to that holy temple, therefore it is my good fortune that I have you. We shall never part.\"\n\n\"Alas, he doesn't know it was I who saved his life,\" the little mermaid thought. \"I carried him over the sea to the garden where the temple stands. I hid behind the foam and watched to see if anyone would come. I saw the pretty maid he loves better than me.\" A sigh was the only sign of her deep distress, for a mermaid cannot cry. \"He says that the other maid belongs to the holy temple. She will never come out into the world, so they will never see each other again. It is I who will care for him, love him, and give all my life to him.\"\n\nNow rumors arose that the Prince was to wed the beautiful daughter of a neighboring King, and that it was for this reason he was having such a superb ship made ready to sail. The rumor ran that the Prince's real interest in visiting the neighboring kingdom was to see the King's daughter, and that he was to travel with a lordly retinue. The little mermaid shook her head and smiled, for she knew the Prince's thoughts far better than anyone else did.\n\n\"I am forced to make this journey,\" he told her. \"I must visit the beautiful Princess, for this is my parents' wish, but they would not have me bring her home as my bride against my own will, and I can never love her. She does not resemble the lovely maiden in the temple, as you do, and if I were to choose a bride, I would sooner choose you, my dear mute foundling with those telling eyes of yours.\" And he kissed her on the mouth, fingered her long hair, and laid his head against her heart so that she came to dream of mortal happiness and an immortal soul.\n\n\"I trust you aren't afraid of the sea, my silent child ' he said, as they went on board the magnificent vessel that was to carry them to the land of the neighboring King. And he told her stories of storms, of ships becalmed, of strange deep-sea fish, and of the wonders that divers have seen. She smiled at such stories, for no one knew about the bottom of the sea as well as she did.\n\nIn the clear moonlight, when everyone except the man at the helm was asleep, she sat on the side of the ship gazing down through the transparent water, and fancied she could catch glimpses of her father's palace. On the topmost tower stood her old grandmother, wearing her silver crown and looking up at the keel of the ship through the rushing waves. Then her sisters rose to the surface, looked at her sadly, and wrung their white hands. She smiled and waved, trying to let them know that all went well and that she was happy. But along came the cabin boy, and her sisters dived out of sight so quickly that the boy supposed the flash of white he had seen was merely foam on the sea.\n\nNext morning the ship came in to the harbor of the neighboring King's glorious city. All the church bells chimed, and trumpets were sounded from all the high towers, while the soldiers lined up with flying banners and glittering bayonets. Every day had a new festivity, as one ball or levee followed another, but the Princess was still to appear. They said she was being brought up in some far-away sacred temple, where she was learning every royal virtue. But she came at last.\n\nThe little mermaid was curious to see how beautiful this Princess was, and she had to grant that a more exquisite figure she had never seen. The Princess's skin was clear and fair, and behind the long, dark lashes her deep blue eyes were smiling and devoted.\n\n\"It was you!\" the Prince cried. \"You are the one who saved me when I lay like a dead man beside the sea.\" He clasped the blushing bride of his choice in his arms. \"Oh, I am happier than a man should be!\" he told his little mermaid. \"My fondest dream - that which I never dared to hope - has come true. You will share in my great joy, for you love me more than anyone does.\"\n\nThe little mermaid kissed his hand and felt that her heart was beginning to break. For the morning after his wedding day would see her dead and turned to watery foam.\n\nAll the church bells rang out, and heralds rode through the streets to announce the wedding. Upon every altar sweet-scented oils were burned in costly silver lamps. The priests swung their censers, the bride and the bridegroom joined their hands, and the bishop blessed their marriage. The little mermaid, clothed in silk and cloth of gold, held the bride's train, but she was deaf to the wedding march and blind to the holy ritual. Her thought turned on her last night upon earth, and on all she had lost in this world.\n\nThat same evening, the bride and bridegroom went aboard the ship. Cannon thundered and banners waved. On the deck of the ship a royal pavilion of purple and gold was set up, and furnished with luxurious cushions. Here the wedded couple were to sleep on that calm, clear night. The sails swelled in the breeze, and the ship glided so lightly that it scarcely seemed to move over the quiet sea. All nightfall brightly colored lanterns were lighted, and the mariners merrily danced on the deck. The little mermaid could not forget that first time she rose from the depths of the sea and looked on at such pomp and happiness. Light as a swallow pursued by his enemies, she joined in the whirling dance. Everyone cheered her, for never had she danced so wonderfully. Her tender feet felt as if they were pierced by daggers, but she did not feel it. Her heart suffered far greater pain. She knew that this was the last evening that she ever would see him for whom she had forsaken her home and family, for whom she had sacrificed her lovely voice and suffered such constant torment, while he knew nothing of all these things. It was the last night that she would breathe the same air with him, or look upon deep waters or the star fields of the blue sky. A never-ending night, without thought and without dreams, awaited her who had no soul and could not get one. The merrymaking lasted long after midnight, yet she laughed and danced on despite the thought of death she carried in her heart. The Prince kissed his beautiful bride and she toyed with his coal-black hair. Hand in hand, they went to rest in the magnificent pavilion.\n\nA hush came over the ship. Only the helmsman remained on deck as the little mermaid leaned her white arms on the bulwarks and looked to the east to see the first red hint of daybreak, for she knew that the first flash of the sun would strike her dead. Then she saw her sisters rise up among the waves. They were as pale as she, and there was no sign of their lovely long hair that the breezes used to blow. It had all been cut off.\n\n'We have given our hair to the witch,\" they said, \"so that she would send you help, and save you from death tonight. She gave us a knife. Here it is. See the sharp blade! Before the sun rises, you must strike it into the Prince's heart, and when his warm blood bathes your feet they will grow together and become a fish tail. Then you will be a mermaid again, able to come back to us in the sea, and live out your three hundred years before you die and turn into dead salt sea foam. Make haste! He or you must die before sunrise. Our old grandmother is so grief-stricken that her white hair is falling fast, just as ours did under the witch's scissors. Kill the Prince and come back to us. Hurry! Hurry! See that red glow in the heavens! In a few minutes the sun will rise and you must die.\" So saying, they gave a strange deep sigh and sank beneath the waves.\n\nThe little mermaid parted the purple curtains of the tent and saw the beautiful bride asleep with her head on the Prince's breast. The mermaid bent down and kissed his shapely forehead. She looked at the sky, fast reddening for the break of day. She looked at the sharp knife and again turned her eyes toward the Prince, who in his sleep murmured the name of his bride. His thoughts were all for her, and the knife blade trembled in the mermaid's hand. But then she flung it from her, far out over the waves. Where it fell the waves were red, as if bubbles of blood seethed in the water. With eyes already glazing she looked once more at the Prince, hurled herself over the bulwarks into the sea, and felt her body dissolve in foam.\n\nThe sun rose up from the waters. Its beams fell, warm and kindly, upon the chill sea foam, and the little mermaid did not feel the hand of death. In the bright sunlight overhead,she saw hundreds of fair ethereal beings. They were so transparent that through them she could see the ship's white sails and the red clouds in the sky. Their voices were sheer music, but so spirit-like that no human ear could detect the sound, just as no eye on earth could see their forms. Without wings, they floated as light as the air itself. The little mermaid discovered that she was shaped like them, and that she was gradually rising up out of the foam.\n\n'Who are you, toward whom I rise?\" she asked, and her voice sounded like those above her, so spiritual that no music on earth could match it.\n\n\"We are the daughters of the air,\" they answered. \"A mermaid has no immortal soul, and can never get one unless she wins the love of a human being. Her eternal life must depend upon a power outside herself. The daughters of the air do not have an immortal soul either, but they can earn one by their good deeds. We fly to the south, where the hot poisonous air kills human beings unless we bring cool breezes. We carry the scent of flowers through the air, bringing freshness and healing balm wherever we go. When for three hundred years we have tried to do all the good that we can, we are given an immortal soul and a share in mankind's eternal bliss. You, poor little mermaid, have tried with your whole heart to do this too. Your suffering and your loyalty have raised you up into the realm of airy spirits, and now in the course of three hundred years you may earn by your good deeds a soul that will never die.\"\n\nThe little mermaid lifted her clear bright eyes toward God's sun, and for the first time her eyes were wet with tears.\n\nOn board the ship all was astir and lively again. She saw the Prince and his fair bride in search of her. Then they gazed sadly into the seething foam, as if they knew she had hurled herself into the waves. Unseen by them, she kissed the bride's forehead, smiled upon the Prince, and rose up with the other daughters of the air to the rose-red clouds that sailed on high.\n\n\"This is the way that we shall rise to the kingdom of God, after three hundred years have passed.\"\n\n\"We may get there even sooner,\" one spirit whispered. \"Unseen, we fly into the homes of men, where there are children, and for every day on which we find a good child who pleases his parents and deserves their love, God shortens our days of trial. The child does not know when we float through his room, but when we smile at him in approval one year is taken from our three hundred. But if we see a naughty, mischievous child we must shed tears of sorrow, and each tear adds a day to the time of our trial.\"",

    "content": "Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to bite and to break, and once, when great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread.\n\nNow when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety. He groaned and said to his wife, \"What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what, husband,\" answered the woman, \"early tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest. There we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them.\"\n\n\"No, wife,\" said the man, \"I will not do that. How can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest? The wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.\"\n\n\"Oh! you fool,\" said she, \"then we must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our coffins,\" and she left him no peace until he consented.\n\n\"But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,\" said the man.\n\nThe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel, \"Now all is over with us.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, Gretel,\" said Hansel, \"do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way to help us.\" And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside.\n\nThe moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel, \"Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,\" and he lay down again in his bed.\n\nWhen day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying, \"Get up, you sluggards. We are going into the forest to fetch wood.\" She gave each a little piece of bread, and said, \"There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.\"\n\nGretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest.\n\nWhen they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said, \"Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.\"\n\n\"Ah, father,\" said Hansel, \"I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me.\"\n\nThe wife said, \"Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.\"\n\nHansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road.\n\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said, \"Now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold.\"\n\nHansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said, \"Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.\"\n\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep.\n\nWhen at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said, \"How are we to get out of the forest now?\"\n\nBut Hansel comforted her and said, \"Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way.\" And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.\n\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, \"You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest? We thought you were never coming back at all.\"\n\nThe father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone.\n\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father:\n\n\"Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again. There is no other means of saving ourselves.\"\n\nThe man's heart was heavy, and he thought, \"It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your children.\" The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says a must say b, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also.\n\nThe children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation. When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said, \"Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.\"\n\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.\n\n\"Hansel, why do you stop and look round?\" Said the father. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me, answered Hansel.\n\n\"Fool.\" Said the woman, \"That is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.\"\n\nHansel, however, little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path. The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before.\n\nThen a great fire was again made, and the mother said, \"Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little. We are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.\"\n\nWhen it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but no one came to the poor children.\n\nThey did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said, \"Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.\"\n\nWhen the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. Hansel said to Gretel, \"We shall soon find the way.\"\n\nBut they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep.\n\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their father's house. They began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted. And when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar.\n\n\"We will set to work on that,\" said Hansel, \"and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.\"\n\nHansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the parlor -\n\n\n\"Nibble, nibble, gnaw\n\nwho is nibbling at my little house?\"\n\nThe children answered\n\n\"The wind, the wind,\n\nthe heaven-born wind,\"\n\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it.\n\nSuddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands.\n\nillustration for Hansel and Gretel\nThe old woman, however, nodded her head, and said, \"Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? Do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you.\"\n\nShe took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven.\n\nThe old woman had only pretended to be so kind. She was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near. When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighborhood, she laughed with malice, and said mockingly, \"I have them, they shall not escape me again.\"\n\nEarly in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks, she muttered to herself, that will be a dainty mouthful.\n\nThen she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried, \"Get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.\"\n\nGretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was forced to do what the wicked witch commanded. And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried, \"Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon be fat.\"\n\nHansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel's finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him.\n\nillustration for Hansel and Gretel\nWhen four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer.\n\n\"Now, then, Gretel,\" she cried to the girl, \"stir yourself, and bring some water. Let Hansel be fat or lean, to-morrow I will kill him, and cook him.\"\n\nAh, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down her cheeks. \"Dear God, do help us,\" she cried. \"If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together.\"\n\n\"Just keep your noise to yourself,\" said the old woman, \"it won't help you at all.\"\n\nEarly in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire.\n\n\"We will bake first,\" said the old woman, \"I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.\" She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting. \"Creep in,\" said the witch, \"and see if it properly heated, so that we can put the bread in.\" And once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.\n\nBut Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said, \"I do not know how I am to do it. How do I get in?\"<> \"Silly goose,\" said the old woman, \"the door is big enough. Just look, I can get in myself.\" And she crept up and thrust her head into the oven.\n\nThen Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt.\n\nillustration for Hansel and Gretel\nOh. Then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away, and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death. Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable, and cried, \"Hansel, we are saved. The old witch is dead.\"\n\nThen Hansel sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other. And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch's house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.\n\n\"These are far better than pebbles.\" Said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in.\n\nAnd Gretel said, \"I, too, will take something home with me,\" and filled her pinafore full.\n\n\"But now we must be off,\" said Hansel, \"that we may get out of the witch's forest.\"\n\nWhen they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of water.\n\n\"We cannot cross,\" said Hansel, \"I see no foot-plank, and no bridge.\n\n\"And there is also no ferry,\" answered Gretel, \"but a white duck is swimming there. If I ask her, she will help us over.\" Then she cried -\n\n\n\"Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\n\nHansel and Gretel are waiting for thee.\n\nThere's never a plank, or bridge in sight,\n\ntake us across on thy back so white.\"\n\nThe duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him.\n\n\"No,\" replied Gretel, \"that will be too heavy for the little duck. She shall take us across, one after the other.\"\n\nThe good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father's house. Then they began to run, rushed into the parlor, and threw themselves round their father's neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest. The woman, however, was dead. Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness.\n\nMy tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.",

    "content": "Cadmus, Phoenix, and Cilix, the three sons of King Agenor, and their little sister Europa (who was a very beautiful child), were at play together near the seashore in their father's kingdom of Phoenicia. They had rambled to some distance from the palace where their parents dwelt, and were now in a verdant meadow, on one side of which lay the sea, all sparkling and dimpling in the sunshine, and murmuring gently against the beach. The three boys were very happy, gathering flowers, and twining them into garlands, with which they adorned the little Europa. Seated on the grass, the child was almost hidden under an abundance of buds and blossoms, whence her rosy face peeped merrily out, and, as Cadmus said, was the prettiest of all the flowers.\n\nJust then, there came a splendid butterfly, fluttering along the meadow; and Cadmus, Phoenix, and Cilix set off in pursuit of it, crying out that it was a flower with wings. Europa, who was a little wearied with playing all day long, did not chase the butterfly with her brothers, but sat still where they had left her, and closed her eyes. For a while, she listened to the pleasant murmur of the sea, which was like a voice saying \"Hush!\" and bidding her go to sleep. But the pretty child, if she slept at all, could not have slept more than a moment, when she heard something trample on the grass, not far from her, and, peeping out from the heap of flowers, beheld a snow-white bull.\n\nAnd whence could this bull have come? Europa and her brothers had been a long time playing in the meadow, and had seen no cattle, nor other living thing, either there or on the neighboring hills.\n\n\"Brother Cadmus!\" cried Europa, starting up out of the midst of the roses and lilies. \"Phoenix! Cilix! Where are you all? Help! Help! Come and drive away this bull!\"\n\nBut her brothers were too far off to hear; especially as the fright took away Europa's voice, and hindered her from calling very loudly. So there she stood, with her pretty mouth wide open, as pale as the white lilies that were twisted among the other flowers in her garlands.\n\nNevertheless, it was the suddenness with which she had perceived the bull, rather than anything frightful in his appearance, that caused Europa so much alarm. On looking at him more attentively, she began to see that he was a beautiful animal, and even fancied a particularly amiable expression in his face. As for his breath--the breath of cattle, you know, is always sweet--it was as fragrant as if he had been grazing on no other food than rosebuds, or at least, the most delicate of clover blossoms. Never before did a bull have such bright and tender eyes, and such smooth horns of ivory, as this one. And the bull ran little races, and capered sportively around the child; so that she quite forgot how big and strong he was, and, from the gentleness and playfulness of his actions, soon came to consider him as innocent a creature as a pet lamb.\n\nThus, frightened as she at first was, you might by and by have seen Europa stroking the bull's forehead with her small white hand, and taking the garlands off her own head to hang them on his neck and ivory horns. Then she pulled up some blades of grass, and he ate them out of her hand, not as if he were hungry, but because he wanted to be friends with the child, and took pleasure in eating what she had touched. Well, my stars! was there ever such a gentle, sweet, pretty, and amiable creature as this bull, and ever such a nice playmate for a little girl?\n\nWhen the animal saw (for the bull had so much intelligence that it is really wonderful to think of), when he saw that Europa was no longer afraid of him, he grew overjoyed, and could hardly contain himself for delight. He frisked about the meadow, now here, now there, making sprightly leaps, with as little effort as a bird expends in hopping from twig to twig. Indeed, his motion was as light as if he were flying through the air, and his hoofs seemed hardly to leave their print in the grassy soil over which he trod. With his spotless hue, he resembled a snow drift, wafted along by the wind. Once he galloped so far away that Europa feared lest she might never see him again; so, setting up her childish voice, called him back.\n\n\"Come back, pretty creature!\" she cried. \"Here is a nice clover blossom.\"\n\nAnd then it was delightful to witness the gratitude of this amiable bull, and how he was so full of joy and thankfulness that he capered higher than ever. He came running, and bowed his head before Europa, as if he knew her to be a king's daughter, or else recognized the important truth that a little girl is everybody's queen. And not only did the bull bend his neck, he absolutely knelt down at her feet, and made such intelligent nods, and other inviting gestures, that Europa understood what he meant just as well as if he had put it in so many words.\n\n\"Come, dear child,\" was what he wanted to say, \"let me give you a ride on my back.\"\n\nAt the first thought of such a thing, Europa drew back. But then she considered in her wise little head that there could be no possible harm in taking just one gallop on the back of this docile and friendly animal, who would certainly set her down the very instant she desired it. And how it would surprise her brothers to see her riding across the green meadow! And what merry times they might have, either taking turns for a gallop, or clambering on the gentle creature, all four children together, and careering round the field with shouts of laughter that would be heard as far off as King Agenor's palace!\n\n\"I think I will do it,\" said the child to herself.\n\nAnd, indeed, why not? She cast a glance around, and caught a glimpse of Cadmus, Phoenix, and Cilix, who were still in pursuit of the butterfly, almost at the other end of the meadow. It would be the quickest way of rejoining them, to get upon the white bull's back. She came a step nearer to him therefore; and--sociable creature that he was--he showed so much joy at this mark of her confidence, that the child could not find in her heart to hesitate any longer. Making one bound (for this little princess was as active as a squirrel), there sat Europa on the beautiful bull, holding an ivory horn in each hand, lest she should fall off.\n\n\"Softly, pretty bull, softly!\" she said, rather frightened at what she had done. \"Do not gallop too fast.\"\n\nHaving got the child on his back, the animal gave a leap into the air, and came down so like a feather that Europa did not know when his hoofs touched the ground. He then began a race to that part of the flowery plain where her three brothers were, and where they had just caught their splendid butterfly. Europa screamed with delight; and Phoenix, Cilix, and Cadmus stood gaping at the spectacle of their sister mounted on a white bull, not knowing whether to be frightened or to wish the same good luck for themselves. The gentle and innocent creature (for who could possibly doubt that he was so?) pranced round among the children as sportively as a kitten. Europa all the while looked down upon her brothers, nodding and laughing, but yet with a sort of stateliness in her rosy little face. As the bull wheeled about to take another gallop across the meadow, the child waved her hand, and said, \"Good-bye,\" playfully pretending that she was now bound on a distant journey, and might not see her brothers again for nobody could tell how long.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" shouted Cadmus, Phoenix, and Cilix, all in one breath.\n\nBut, together with her enjoyment of the sport, there was still a little remnant of fear in the child's heart; so that her last look at the three boys was a troubled one, and made them feel as if their dear sister were really leaving them forever. And what do you think the snowy bull did next? Why, he set off, as swift as the wind, straight down to the seashore, scampered across the sand, took an airy leap, and plunged right in among the foaming billows. The white spray rose in a shower over him and little Europa, and fell spattering down upon the water.\n\nThen what a scream of terror did the poor child send forth! The three brothers screamed manfully, likewise, and ran to the shore as fast as their legs would carry them, with Cadmus at their head. But it was too late. When they reached the margin of the sand, the treacherous animal was already far away in the wide blue sea, with only his snowy head and tail emerging, and poor little Europa between them, stretching out one hand towards her dear brothers, while she grasped the bull's ivory horn with the other. And there stood Cadmus, Phoenix, and Cilix, gazing at this sad spectacle, through their tears, until they could no longer distinguish the bull's snowy head from the white-capped billows that seemed to boil up out of the sea's depths around him. Nothing more was ever seen of the white bull--nothing more of the beautiful child.\n\nThis was a mournful story, as you may well think, for the three boys to carry home to their parents. King Agenor, their father, was the ruler of the whole country; but he loved his little daughter Europa better than his kingdom, or than all his other children, or than anything else in the world. Therefore, when Cadmus and his two brothers came crying home, and told him how that a white bull had carried off their sister, and swam with her over the sea, the king was quite beside himself with grief and rage. Although it was now twilight, and fast growing dark, he bade them set out instantly in search of her.\n\n\"Never shall you see my face again,\" he cried, \"unless you bring me back my little Europa, to gladden me with her smiles and her pretty ways. Begone, and enter my presence no more, till you come leading her by the hand.\"\n\nAs King Agenor said this, his eyes flashed fire (for he was a very passionate king), and he looked so terribly angry that the poor boys did not even venture to ask for their suppers, but slunk away out of the palace, and only paused on the steps a moment to consult whither they should go first. While they were standing there, all in dismay, their mother, Queen Telephassa (who happened not to be by when they told the story to the king), came hurrying after them, and said that she too would go in quest of her daughter.\n\n\"O, no, mother!\" cried the boys. \"The night is dark, and there is no knowing what troubles and perils we may meet with.\"\n\n\"Alas! my dear children,\" answered poor Queen Telephassa; weeping bitterly, \"that is only another reason why I should go with you. If I should lose you, too, as well as my little Europa, what would become of me!\"\n\n\"And let me go likewise!\" said their playfellow Thasus, who came running to join them.\n\nThasus was the son of a seafaring person in the neighborhood; he had been brought up with the young princes, and was their intimate friend, and loved Europa very much; so they consented that he should accompany them. The whole party, therefore, set forth together. Cadmus, Phoenix, Cilix, and Thasus clustered round Queen Telephassa, grasping her skirts, and begging her to lean upon their shoulders whenever she felt weary. In this manner they went down the palace steps, and began a journey, which turned out to be a great deal longer than they dreamed of. The last that they saw of King Agenor, he came to the door, with a servant holding a torch beside him, and called after them into the gathering darkness:\n\n\"Remember! Never ascend these steps again without the child!\"\n\n\"Never!\" sobbed Queen Telephassa; and the three brothers and Thasus answered, \"Never! Never! Never! Never!\"\n\nAnd they kept their word. Year after year, King Agenor sat in the solitude of his beautiful palace, listening in vain for their returning footsteps, hoping to hear the familiar voice of the queen, and the cheerful talk of his sons and their playfellow Thasus, entering the door together, and the sweet, childish accents of little Europa in the midst of them. But so long a time went by, that, at last, if they had really come, the king would not have known that this was the voice of Telephassa, and these the younger voices that used to make such joyful echoes, when the children were playing about the palace. We must now leave King Agenor to sit on his throne, and must go along with Queen Telephassa, and her four youthful companions.\n\nThey went on and on, and traveled a long way, and passed over mountains and rivers, and sailed over seas. Here, and there, and everywhere, they made continual inquiry if any person could tell them what had become of Europa. The rustic people, of whom they asked this question, paused a little while from their labors in the field, and looked very much surprised. They thought it strange to behold a woman in the garb of a queen (for Telephassa in her haste had forgotten to take off her crown and her royal robes), roaming about the country, with four lads around her, on such an errand as this seemed to be. But nobody could give them any tidings of Europa; nobody had seen a little girl dressed like a princess, and mounted on a snow-white bull, which galloped as swiftly as the wind.\n\nI cannot tell you how long Queen Telephassa, and Cadmus, Phoenix, and Cilix, her three sons, and Thasus, their playfellow, went wandering along the highways and bypaths, or through the pathless wildernesses of the earth, in this manner. But certain it is, that, before they reached any place of rest, their splendid garments were quite worn out. They all looked very much travel-stained, and would have had the dust of many countries on their shoes, if the streams, through which they waded, had not washed it all away. When they had been gone a year, Telephassa threw away her crown, because it chafed her forehead.\n\n\"It has given me many a headache,\" said the poor queen, \"and it cannot cure my heartache.\"\n\nAs fast as their princely robes got torn and tattered, they exchanged them for such mean attire as ordinary people wore. By and by, they come to have a wild and homeless aspect; so that you would much sooner have taken them for a gypsy family than a queen and three princes, and a young nobleman, who had once a palace for a home, and a train of servants to do their bidding. The four boys grew up to be tall young men, with sunburnt faces. Each of them girded on a sword, to defend themselves against the perils of the way. When the husbandmen, at whose farmhouses they sought hospitality, needed their assistance in the harvest field, they gave it willingly; and Queen Telephassa (who had done no work in her palace, save to braid silk threads with golden ones) came behind them to bind the sheaves. If payment was offered, they shook their heads, and only asked for tidings of Europa.\n\n\"There are bulls enough in my pasture,\" the old farmers would reply; \"but I never heard of one like this you tell me of. A snow-white bull with a little princess on his back! Ho! ho! I ask your pardon, good folks; but there never such a sight seen hereabouts.\"\n\nAt last, when his upper lip began to have the down on it, Phoenix grew weary of rambling hither and thither to no purpose. So one day, when they happened to be passing through a pleasant and solitary tract of country, he sat himself down on a heap of moss.\n\n\"I can go no farther,\" said Phoenix. \"It is a mere foolish waste of life, to spend it as we do, always wandering up and down, and never coming to any home at nightfall. Our sister is lost, and never will be found. She probably perished in the sea; or, to whatever shore the white bull may have carried her, it is now so many years ago, that there would be neither love nor acquaintance between us, should we meet again. My father has forbidden us to return to his palace, so I shall build me a hut of branches, and dwell here.\"\n\n\"Well, son Phoenix,\" said Telephassa, sorrowfully, \"you have grown to be a man, and must do as you judge best. But, for my part, I will still go in quest of my poor child.\"\n\n\"And we three will go along with you!\" cried Cadmus and Cilix, and their faithful friend Thasus.\n\nBut, before setting out, they all helped Phoenix to build a habitation. When completed, it was a sweet rural bower, roofed overhead with an arch of living boughs. Inside there were two pleasant rooms, one of which had a soft heap of moss for a bed, while the other was furnished with a rustic seat or two, curiously fashioned out of the crooked roots of trees. So comfortable and home-like did it seem, that Telephassa and her three companions could not help sighing, to think that they must still roam about the world, instead of spending the remainder of their lives in some such cheerful abode as they had here built for Phoenix. But, when they bade him farewell, Phoenix shed tears, and probably regretted that he was no longer to keep them company.\n\nHowever, he had fixed upon an admirable place to dwell in. And by and by there came other people, who chanced to have no homes; and, seeing how pleasant a spot it was, they built themselves huts in the neighborhood of Phoenix's habitation. Thus, before many years went by, a city had grown up there, in the center of which was seen a stately palace of marble, wherein dwelt Phoenix, clothed in a purple robe, and wearing a golden crown upon his head. For the inhabitants of the new city, finding that he had royal blood in his veins, had chosen him to be their king. The very first decree of state which King Phoenix issued was, that, if a maiden happened to arrive in the kingdom, mounted on a snow-white bull, and calling herself Europa, his subjects should treat her with the greatest kindness and respect, and immediately bring her to the palace. You may see, by this, that Phoenix's conscience never quite ceased to trouble him, for giving up the quest of his dear sister, and sitting himself down to be comfortable, while his mother and her companions went onward.\n\nBut often and often, at the close of a weary day's journey, did Telephassa and Cadmus, Cilix, and Thasus, remember the pleasant spot in which they had left Phoenix. It was a sorrowful prospect for these wanderers, that on the morrow they must again set forth, and that, after many nightfalls, they would perhaps be no nearer the close of their toilsome pilgrimage than now. These thoughts made them all melancholy at times, but appeared to torment Cilix more than the rest of the party. At length, one morning, when they were taking their staffs in hand to set out, he thus addressed them:\n\n\"My dear mother, and you, good brother Cadmus, and my friend Thasus, methinks we are like people in a dream. There is no substance in the life which we are leading. It is such a dreary length of time since the white bull carried off my sister Europa, that I have quite forgotten how she looked, and the tones of her voice, and, indeed, almost doubt whether such a little girl ever lived in the world. And whether she once lived or no, I am convinced that she no longer survives, and that therefore it is the merest folly to waste our own lives and happiness in seeking her. Were we to find her, she would now be a woman grown, and would look upon us all as strangers. So, to tell you the truth, I have resolved to take up my abode here; and I entreat you, mother, brother, and friend, to follow my example.\"\n\n\"Not I, for one,\" said Telephassa; although the poor queen, firmly as she spoke, was so travel-worn that she could hardly put her foot to the ground. \"Not I, for one! In the depths of my heart, little Europa is still the rosy child who ran to gather flowers so many years ago. She has not grown to womanhood, nor forgotten me. At noon, at night, journeying onward, sitting down to rest, her childish voice is always in my ears, calling, 'Mother! mother!' Stop here who may, there is no repose for me.\"\n\n\"Nor for me,\" said Cadmus, \"while my dear mother pleases to go onward.\"\n\nAnd the faithful Thasus, too, was resolved to bear them company. They remained with Cilix a few days, however, and helped him to build a rustic bower, resembling the one which they had formerly built for Phoenix.\n\nWhen they were bidding him farewell Cilix burst into tears, and told his mother that it seemed just as melancholy a dream to stay there, in solitude, as to go onward. If she really believed that they would ever find Europa, he was willing to continue the search with them, even now. But Telephassa bade him remain there, and be happy, if his own heart would let him. So the pilgrims took their leave of him, and departed, and were hardly out of sight before some other wandering people came along that way, and saw Cilix's habitation, and were greatly delighted with the appearance of the place. There being abundance of unoccupied ground in the neighborhood, these strangers built huts for themselves, and were soon joined by a multitude of new settlers, who quickly formed a city. In the middle of it was seen a magnificent palace of colored marble, on the balcony of which, every noontide, appeared Cilix, in a long purple robe, and with a jeweled crown upon his head; for the inhabitants, when they found out that he was a king's son, had considered him the fittest of all men to be a king himself.\n\nOne of the first acts of King Cilix's government was to send out an expedition, consisting of a grave ambassador, and an escort of bold and hardy young men, with orders to visit the principal kingdoms of the earth, and inquire whether a young maiden had passed through those regions, galloping swiftly on a white bull. It is, therefore, plain to my mind, that Cilix secretly blamed himself for giving up the search for Europa, as long as he was able to put one foot before the other.\n\nAs for Telephassa, and Cadmus, and the good Thasus, it grieves me to think of them, still keeping up that weary pilgrimage. The two young men did their best for the poor queen, helping her over the rough places, often carrying her across rivulets in their faithful arms and seeking to shelter her at nightfall, even when they themselves lay on the ground. Sad, sad it was to hear them asking of every passer-by if he had seen Europa, so long after the white bull had carried her away. But, though the gray years thrust themselves between, and made the child's figure dim in their remembrance, neither of these true-hearted three ever dreamed of giving up the search.\n\nOne morning, however, poor Thasus found that he had sprained his ankle, and could not possibly go a step farther.\n\n\"After a few days, to be sure,\" said he, mournfully, \"I might make shift to hobble along with a stick. But that would only delay you, and perhaps hinder you from finding dear little Europa, after all your pains and trouble. Do you go forward, therefore, my beloved companions, and leave me to follow as I may.\"\n\n\"Thou hast been a true friend, dear Thasus,\" said Queen Telephassa, kissing his forehead. \"Being neither my son, nor the brother of our lost Europa, thou hast shown thyself truer to me and her than Phoenix and Cilix did, whom we have left behind us. Without thy loving help, and that of my son Cadmus, my limbs could not have borne me half so far as this. Now, take thy rest, and be at peace. For--and it is the first time I have owned it to myself--I begin to question whether we shall ever find my beloved daughter in this world.\"\n\nSaying this, the poor queen shed tears, because it was a grievous trial to the mother's heart to confess that her hopes were growing faint. From that day forward, Cadmus noticed that she never traveled with the same alacrity of spirit that had heretofore supported her. Her weight was heavier upon his arm.\n\nBefore setting out, Cadmus helped Thasus build a bower; while Telephassa, being too infirm to give any great assistance, advised them how to fit it up and furnish it, so that it might be as comfortable as a hut of branches could. Thasus, however, did not spend all his days in this green bower. For it happened to him, as to Phoenix and Cilix, that other homeless people visited the spot, and liked it, and built themselves habitations in the neighborhood. So here, in the course of a few years, was another thriving city, with a red freestone palace in the center of it, where Thasus sat upon a throne, doing justice to the people, with a purple robe over his shoulders, a sceptre in his hand, and a crown upon his head. The inhabitants had made him king, not for the sake of any royal blood (for none was in his veins), but because Thasus was an upright, true-hearted, and courageous man, and therefore fit to rule.\n\nBut when the affairs of his kingdom were all settled, King Thasus laid aside his purple robe and crown, and sceptre, and bade his worthiest subjects distribute justice to the people in his stead. Then, grasping the pilgrim's staff that had supported him so long, he set forth again, hoping still to discover some hoof-mark of the snow-white bull, some trace of the vanished child. He returned after a lengthened absence, and sat down wearily upon his throne. To his latest hour, nevertheless, King Thasus showed his true-hearted remembrance of Europa, by ordering that a fire should always be kept burning in his palace, and a bath steaming hot, and food ready to be served up, and a bed with snow-white sheets, in case the maiden should arrive, and require immediate refreshment. And, though Europa never came, the good Thasus had the blessings of many a poor traveler, who profited by the food and lodging which were meant for the little playmate of the king's boyhood.\n\nTelephassa and Cadmus were now pursuing their weary way, with no companion but each other. The queen leaned heavily upon her son's arm, and could walk only a few miles a day. But for all her weakness and weariness, she would not be persuaded to give up the search. It was enough to bring tears into the eyes of bearded men to hear the melancholy tone with which she inquired of every stranger whether he could not tell her any news of the lost child.\n\n\"Have you seen a little girl--no, no, I mean a young maiden of full growth--passing by this way, mounted on a snow-white bull, which gallops as swiftly as the wind?\"\n\n\"We have seen no such wondrous sight,\" the people would reply; and very often, taking Cadmus aside, they whispered to him, \"Is this stately and sad-looking woman your mother? Surely she is not in her right mind; and you ought to take her home, and make her comfortable, and do your best to get this dream out of her fancy.\"\n\n\"It is no dream,\" said Cadmus. \"Everything else is a dream, save that.\"\n\nBut, one day, Telephassa seemed feebler than usual, and leaned almost her whole weight on the arm of Cadmus, and walked more slowly than ever before. At last they reached a solitary spot, where she told her son that she must needs lie down, and take a good long rest.\n\n\"A good long rest!\" she repeated, looking Cadmus tenderly in the face. \"A good long rest, thou dearest one!\"\n\n\"As long as you please, dear mother,\" answered Cadmus.\n\nTelephassa bade him sit down on the turf beside her, and then she took his hand.\n\n\"My son,\" said she, fixing her dim eyes most lovingly upon him, \"this rest that I speak of will be very long indeed! You must not wait till it is finished. Dear Cadmus, you do not comprehend me. You must make a grave here, and lay your mother's weary frame into it. My pilgrimage is over.\"\n\nCadmus burst into tears, and, for a long time, refused to believe that his dear mother was now to be taken from him. But Telephassa reasoned with him, and kissed him, and at length made him discern that it was better for her spirit to pass away out of the toil, the weariness, and grief, and disappointment which had burdened her on earth, ever since the child was lost. He therefore repressed his sorrow, and listened to her last words.\n\n\"Dearest Cadmus,\" said she, \"thou hast been the truest son that ever mother had, and faithful to the very last. Who else would have borne with my infirmities as thou hast! It is owing to thy care, thou tenderest child, that my grave was not dug long years ago, in some valley, or on some hillside, that lies far, far behind us. It is enough. Thou shalt wander no more on this hopeless search. But, when thou hast laid thy mother in the earth, then go, my son, to Delphi, and inquire of the oracle what thou shalt do next.\"\n\n\"O mother, mother,\" cried Cadmus, \"couldst thou but have seen my sister before this hour!\"\n\n\"It matters little now,\" answered Telephassa, and there was a smile upon her face. \"I go now to the better world, and, sooner or later, shall find my daughter there.\"\n\nI will not sadden you, my little hearers, with telling how Telephassa died and was buried, but will only say, that her dying smile grew brighter, instead of vanishing from her dead face; so that Cadmus left convinced that, at her very first step into the better world, she had caught Europa in her arms. He planted some flowers on his mother's grave, and left them to grow there, and make the place beautiful, when he should be far away.\n\nAfter performing this last sorrowful duty, he set forth alone, and took the road towards the famous oracle of Delphi, as Telephassa had advised him. On his way thither, he still inquired of most people whom he met whether they had seen Europa; for, to say the truth, Cadmus had grown so accustomed to ask the question, that it came to his lips as readily as a remark about the weather. He received various answers. Some told him one thing, and some another. Among the rest, a mariner affirmed, that, many years before, in a distant country, he had heard a rumor about a white bull, which came swimming across the sea with a child on his back, dressed up in flowers that were blighted by the sea water. He did not know what had become of the child or the bull; and Cadmus suspected, indeed, by a queer twinkle in the mariner's eyes, that he was putting a joke upon him, and had never really heard anything about the matter.\n\nPoor Cadmus found it more wearisome to travel alone than to bear all his dear mother's weight, while she had kept him company. His heart, you will understand, was now so heavy that it seemed impossible, sometimes, to carry it any farther. But his limbs were strong and active, and well accustomed to exercise. He walked swiftly along, thinking of King Agenor and Queen Telephassa, and his brothers, and the friendly Thasus, all of whom he had left behind him, at one point of his pilgrimage or another, and never expected to see them any more. Full of these remembrances, he came within sight of a lofty mountain, which the people thereabouts told him was called Parnassus. On the slope of Mount Parnassus was the famous Delphi, whither Cadmus was going.\n\nThis Delphi was supposed to be the very midmost spot of the whole world. The place of the oracle was a certain cavity in the mountain side, over which, when Cadmus came thither, he found a rude bower of branches. It reminded him of those which he had helped to build for Phoenix and Cilix, and afterwards for Thasus. In later times, when multitudes of people came from great distances to put questions to the oracle, a spacious temple of marble was erected over the spot. But in the days of Cadmus, as I have told you, there was only this rustic bower, with its abundance of green foliage, and a tuft of shrubbery, that ran wild over the mysterious hole in the hillside.\n\nWhen Cadmus had thrust a passage through the tangled boughs, and made his way into the bower, he did not at first discern the half-hidden cavity. But soon he felt a cold stream of air rushing out of it, with so much force that it shook the ringlets on his cheek. Pulling away the shrubbery which clustered over the hole, he bent forward, and spoke in a distinct but reverential tone, as if addressing some unseen personage inside of the mountain.\n\n\"Sacred oracle of Delphi,\" said he, \"whither shall I go next in quest of my dear sister Europa?\"\n\nThere was at first a deep silence, and then a rushing sound, or a noise like a long sigh, proceeding out of the interior of the earth. This cavity, you must know, was looked upon as a sort of fountain of truth, which sometimes gushed out in audible words; although, for the most part, these words were such a riddle that they might just as well have staid at the bottom of the hole. But Cadmus was more fortunate than many others who went to Delphi in search of truth. By and by, the rushing noise began to sound like articulate language. It repeated, over and over again, the following sentence, which, after all, was so like the vague whistle of a blast of air, that Cadmus really did not quite know whether it meant anything or not:\n\n\"Seek her no more! Seek her no more! Seek her no more!\"\n\n\"What, then, shall I do?\" asked Cadmus.\n\nFor, ever since he was a child, you know, it had been the great object of his life to find his sister. From the very hour that he left following the butterfly in the meadow, near his father's palace, he had done his best to follow Europa, over land and sea. And now, if he must give up the search, he seemed to have no more business in the world.\n\nBut again the sighing gust of air grew into something like a hoarse voice.\n\n\"Follow the cow!\" it said. \"Follow the cow! Follow the cow!\"\n\nAnd when these words had been repeated until Cadmus was tired of hearing them (especially as he could not imagine what cow it was, or why he was to follow her), the gusty hole gave vent to another sentence.\n\n\"Where the stray cow lies down, there is your home.\"\n\nThese words were pronounced but a single time, and died away into a whisper before Cadmus was fully satisfied that he had caught the meaning. He put other questions, but received no answer; only the gust of wind sighed continually out of the cavity, and blew the withered leaves rustling along the ground before it.\n\n\"Did there really come any words out of the hole?\" thought Cadmus; \"or have I been dreaming all this while?\"\n\nHe turned away from the oracle, and thought himself no wiser than when he came thither. Caring little what might happen to him, he took the first path that offered itself, and went along at a sluggish pace; for, having no object in view, nor any reason to go one way more than another, it would certainly have been foolish to make haste. Whenever he met anybody, the old question was at his tongue's end.\n\n\"Have you seen a beautiful maiden, dressed like a king's daughter, and mounted on a snow-white bull, that gallops as swiftly as the wind?\"\n\nBut, remembering what the oracle had said, he only half uttered the words, and then mumbled the rest indistinctly; and from his confusion, people must have imagined that this handsome young man had lost his wits.\n\nI know not how far Cadmus had gone, nor could he himself have told you, when at no great distance before him, he beheld a brindled cow. She was lying down by the wayside, and quietly chewing her cud; nor did she take any notice of the young man until he had approached pretty nigh. Then, getting leisurely upon her feet, and giving her head a gentle toss, she began to move along at a moderate pace, often pausing just long enough to crop a mouthful of grass. Cadmus loitered behind, whistling idly to himself, and scarcely noticing the cow; until the thought occurred to him, whether this could possibly be the animal which, according to the oracle's response, was to serve him for a guide. But he smiled at himself for fancying such a thing. He could not seriously think that this was the cow, because she went along so quietly, behaving just like any other cow. Evidently she neither knew nor cared so much as a wisp of hay about Cadmus, and was only thinking how to get her living along the wayside, where the herbage was green and fresh. Perhaps she was going home to be milked.\n\n\"Cow, cow, cow!\" cried Cadmus. \"Hey, Brindle, hey! Stop, my good cow!\"\n\nHe wanted to come up with the cow, so as to examine her, and see if she would appear to know him, or whether there were any peculiarities to distinguish her from a thousand other cows, whose only business is to fill the milk-pail, and sometimes kick it over. But still the brindled cow trudged on, whisking her tail to keep the flies away, and taking as little notice of Cadmus as she well could. If he walked slowly, so did the cow, and seized the opportunity to graze. If he quickened his pace, the cow went just so much the faster; and once, when Cadmus tried to catch her by running, she threw out her heels, stuck her tail straight on end, and set off at a gallop, looking as queerly as cows generally do, while putting themselves to their speed.\n\nWhen Cadmus saw that it was impossible to come up with her, he walked on moderately, as before. The cow, too, went leisurely on, without looking behind. Wherever the grass was greenest, there she nibbled a mouthful or two. Where a brook glistened brightly across the path, there the cow drank, and breathed a comfortable sigh, and drank again. and trudged onward at the pace that best suited herself and Cadmus.\n\n\"I do believe,\" thought Cadmus, \"that this may be the cow that was foretold me. If it be the one, I suppose she will lie down somewhere hereabouts.\"\n\nWhether it were the oracular cow or some other one, it did not seem reasonable that she should travel a great way farther. So, whenever they reached a particularly pleasant spot on a breezy hillside, or in a sheltered vale, or flowery meadow, on the shore of a calm lake, or along the bank of a clear stream, Cadmus looked eagerly around to see if the situation would suit him for a home. But still, whether he liked the place or no, the brindled cow never offered to lie down. On she went at the quiet pace of a cow going homeward to the barn yard; and, every moment, Cadmus expected to see a milkmaid approaching with a pail, or a herdsman running to head the stray animal, and turn her back towards the pasture. But no milkmaid came; no herdsman drove her back; and Cadmus followed the stray Brindle till he was almost ready to drop down with fatigue.\n\n\"O brindled cow,\" cried he, in a tone of despair, \"do you never mean to stop?\"\n\nHe had now grown too intent on following her to think of lagging behind, however long the way, and whatever might be his fatigue. Indeed, it seemed as if there were something about the animal that bewitched people. Several persons who happened to see the brindled cow, and Cadmus following behind, began to trudge after her, precisely as he did. Cadmus was glad of somebody to converse with, and therefore talked very freely to these good people. He told them all his adventures, and how he had left King Agenor in his palace, and Phoenix at one place, and Cilix at another, and Thasus at a third, and his dear mother, Queen Telephassa, under a flowery sod; so that now he was quite alone, both friendless and homeless. He mentioned, likewise, that the oracle had bidden him be guided by a cow, and inquired of the strangers whether they supposed that this brindled animal could be the one.\n\n\"Why, 'tis a very wonderful affair,\" answered one of his new companions. \"I am pretty well acquainted with the ways of cattle, and I never knew a cow, of her own accord, to go so far without stopping. If my legs will let me, I'll never leave following the beast till she lies down.\"\n\n\"Nor I!\" said a second.\n\n\"Nor I!\" cried a third. \"If she goes a hundred miles farther, I am determined to see the end of it.\"\n\nThe secret of it was, you must know, that the cow was an enchanted cow, and that, without their being conscious of it, she threw some of her enchantment over everybody that took so much as half a dozen steps behind her. They could not possibly help following her, though all the time they fancied themselves doing it of their own accord. The cow was by no means very nice in choosing her path; so that sometimes they had to scramble over rocks, or wade through mud and mire, and all in a terribly bedraggled condition, and tired to death, and very hungry, into the bargain. What a weary business it was!\n\nBut still they kept trudging stoutly forward, and talking as they went. The strangers grew very fond of Cadmus, and resolved never to leave him, but to help him build a city wherever the cow might lie down. In the center of it there should be a noble palace, in which Cadmus might dwell, and be their king, with a throne, a crown, a sceptre, a purple robe, and everything else that a king ought to have; for in him there was the royal blood, and the royal heart, and the head that knew how to rule.\n\nWhile they were talking of these schemes, and beguiling the tediousness of the way with laying out the plan of the new city, one of the company happened to look at the cow.\n\n\"Joy! joy!\" cried he, clapping his hands. \"Brindle is going to lie down.\"\n\nThey all looked; and, sure enough, the cow had stopped, and was staring leisurely about her, as other cows do when on the point of lying down. And slowly, slowly did she recline herself on the soft grass, first bending her forelegs, and then crouching her hind ones. When Cadmus and his companions came up with her, there was the brindled cow taking her ease, chewing her cud, and looking them quietly in the face; as if this was just the spot she had been seeking for, and as if it were all a matter of course.\n\n\"This, then,\" said Cadmus, gazing around him, \"this is to be my home.\"\n\nIt was a fertile and lovely plain, with great trees flinging their sun-speckled shadows over it, and hills fencing it in from the rough weather. At no great distance, they beheld a river gleaming in the sunshine. A home feeling stole into the heart of poor Cadmus. He was very glad to know that here he might awake in the morning without the necessity of putting on his dusty sandals to travel farther and farther. The days and the years would pass over him, and find him still in this pleasant spot. If he could have had his brothers with him, and his friend Thasus, and could have seen his dear mother under a roof of his own, he might here have been happy after all their disappointments. Some day or other, too, his sister Europa might have come quietly to the door of his home, and smiled round upon the familiar faces. But, indeed, since there was no hope of regaining the friends of his boyhood, or ever seeing his dear sister again, Cadmus resolved to make himself happy with these new companions, who had grown so fond of him while following the cow.\n\n\"Yes, my friends,\" said he to them, \"this is to be our home. Here we will build our habitations. The brindled cow, which has led us hither, will supply us with milk. We will cultivate the neighboring soil. and lead an innocent and happy life.\"\n\nHis companions joyfully assented to this plan; and, in the first place, being very hungry and thirsty, they looked about them for the means of providing a comfortable meal. Not far off they saw a tuft of trees, which appeared as if there might be a spring of water beneath them. They went thither to fetch some, leaving Cadmus stretched on the ground along with the brindled cow; for, now that he had found a place of rest, it seemed as if all the weariness of his pilgrimage, ever since he left King Agenor's palace, had fallen upon him at once. But his new friends had not long been gone, when he was suddenly startled by cries, shouts, and screams, and the noise of a terrible struggle, and in the midst of it all, a most awful hissing, which went right through his ears like a rough saw.\n\nRunning towards the tuft of trees, he beheld the head and fiery eyes of an immense serpent or dragon, with the widest jaws that ever a dragon had, and a vast many rows of horribly sharp teeth. Before Cadmus could reach the spot, this pitiless reptile had killed his poor companions, and was busily devouring them, making but a mouthful of each man.\n\nIt appears that the fountain of water was enchanted, and that the dragon had been set to guard it, so that no mortal might ever quench his thirst there. As the neighboring inhabitants carefully avoided the spot, it was now a long time (not less than a hundred years or thereabouts) since the monster had broken his fast; and, as was natural enough, his appetite had grown to be enormous, and was not half satisfied by the poor people whom he had just eaten up. When he caught sight of Cadmus, therefore, he set up another abominable hiss, and flung back his immense jaws, until his mouth looked like a great red cavern, at the farther end of which were seen the legs of his last victim, whom he had hardly had time to swallow.\n\nBut Cadmus was so enraged at the destruction of his friends that he cared neither for the size of the dragon's jaws nor for his hundreds of sharp teeth. Drawing his sword, he rushed at the monster, and flung himself right into his cavernous mouth. This bold method of attacking him took the dragon by surprise; for, in fact, Cadmus had leaped so far down into his throat, that the rows of terrible teeth could not close upon him, nor do him the least harm in the world. Thus, though the struggle was a tremendous one, and though the dragon shattered the tuft of trees into small splinters by the lashing of his tail, yet, as Cadmus was all the while slashing and stabbing at his very vitals, it was not long before the scaly wretch bethought himself of slipping away. He had not gone his length, however, when the brave Cadmus gave him a sword thrust that finished the battle; and creeping out of the gateway of the creature's jaws, there he beheld him still wriggling his vast bulk, although there was no longer life enough in him to harm a little child.\n\nBut do not you suppose that it made Cadmus sorrowful to think of the melancholy fate which had befallen those poor, friendly people, who had followed the cow along with him? It seemed as if he were doomed to lose everybody whom he loved, or to see them perish in one way or another. And here he was, after all his toils and troubles, in a solitary place, with not a single human being to help him build a hut.\n\n\"What shall I do?\" cried he aloud. \"It were better for me to have been devoured by the dragon, as my poor companions were.\"\n\n\"Cadmus,\" said a voice but whether it came from above or below him, or whether it spoke within his own breast, the young man could not tell--\"Cadmus, pluck out the dragon's teeth, and plant them in the earth.\"\n\nThis was a strange thing to do; nor was it very easy, I should imagine, to dig out all those deep-rooted fangs from the dead dragon's jaws. But Cadmus toiled and tugged, and after pounding the monstrous head almost to pieces with a great stone, he at last collected as many teeth as might have filled a bushel or two. The next thing was to plant them. This, likewise, was a tedious piece of work, especially as Cadmus was already exhausted with killing the dragon and knocking his head to pieces, and had nothing to dig the earth with, that I know of, unless it were his sword blade. Finally, however, a sufficiently large tract o ground was turned up, and sown with this new kind of seed; although half of the dragon's teeth still remained to be planted some other day.\n\nCadmus, quite out of breath, stood leaning upon his sword, and wondering what was to happen next. He had waited but a few moments, when he began to see a sight, which was as great a marvel as the most marvelous thing I ever told you about.\n\nThe sun was shining slantwise over the field, and showed all the moist, dark soil just like any other newly-planted piece of ground. All at once, Cadmus fancied he saw something glisten very brightly, first at one spot, then at another, and then at a hundred and a thousand spots together. Soon he perceived them to be the steel heads of spears, sprouting up everywhere like so many stalks of grain, and continually growing taller and taller. Next appeared a vast number of bright sword blades, thrusting themselves up in the same way. A moment afterwards, the whole surface of the ground was broken by a multitude of polished brass helmets, coming up like a crop of enormous beans. So rapidly did they grow, that Cadmus now discerned the fierce countenance of a man beneath every one. In short, before he had time to think what a wonderful affair it was, he beheld an abundant harvest of what looked like human beings, armed with helmets and breastplates, shields, swords, and spears; and before they were well out of the earth, they brandished their weapons, and clashed them one against another, seeming to think, little while as they had yet lived, that they had wasted too much of life without a battle. Every tooth of the dragon had produced one of these sons of deadly mischief.\n\nUp sprouted also a great many trumpeters; and with the first breath that they drew, they put their brazen trumpets to their lips, and sounded a tremendous and ear-shattering blast, so that the whole space, just now so quiet and solitary, reverberated with the clash and clang of arms, the bray of warlike music, and the shouts of angry men. So enraged did they all look, that Cadmus fully expected them to put the whole world to the sword. How fortunate would it be for a great conqueror, if he could get a bushel of the dragon's teeth to sow!\n\n\"Cadmus,\" said the same voice which he had before heard, \"throw a stone into the midst of the armed men.\"\n\nSo Cadmus seized a large stone, and flinging it into the middle of the earth army, saw it strike the breastplate of a gigantic and fierce-looking warrior. Immediately on feeling the blow, he seemed to take it for granted that somebody had struck him; and, uplifting his weapon, he smote his next neighbor a blow that cleft his helmet asunder, and stretched him on the ground. In an instant, those nearest the fallen warrior began to strike at one another with their swords, and stab with their spears. The confusion spread wider and wider. Each man smote down his brother, and was himself smitten down before he had time to exult in his victory. The trumpeters, all the while, blew their blasts shriller and shriller; each soldier shouted a battle cry, and often fell with it on his lips. It was the strangest spectacle of causeless wrath, and of mischief for no good end, that had ever been witnessed; but, after all, it was neither more foolish nor more wicked than a thousand battles that have since been fought, in which men have slain their brothers with just as little reason as these children of the dragon's teeth. It ought to be considered, too, that the dragon people were made for nothing else; whereas other mortals were born to love and help one another.\n\nWell, this memorable battle continued to rage until the ground was strewn with helmeted heads that had been cut off. Of all the thousands that began the fight, there were only five left standing. These now rushed from different parts of the field, and, meeting in the middle of it, clashed their swords, and struck at each other's hearts as fiercely as ever.\n\n\"Cadmus,\" said the voice again, \"bid those five warriors sheathe their swords. They will help you to build the city.\"\n\nWithout hesitating an instant, Cadmus stepped forward, with the aspect of a king and a leader, and extending his drawn sword amongst them, spoke to the warriors in a stern and commanding voice.\n\n\"Sheathe your weapons!\" said he.\n\nAnd forthwith, feeling themselves bound to obey him, the five remaining sons of the dragon's teeth made him a military salute with their swords, returned them to the scabbards, and stood before Cadmus in a rank, eyeing him as soldiers eye their captain, while awaiting the word of command.\n\nThese five men had probably sprung from the biggest of the dragon's teeth, and were the boldest and strongest of the whole army. They were almost giants indeed, and had good need to be so, else they never could have lived through so terrible a fight. They still had a very furious look, and, if Cadmus happened to glance aside, would glare at one another, with fire flashing out of their eyes. It was strange, too, to observe how the earth, out of which they had so lately grown, was incrusted, here and there, on their bright breastplates, and even, begrimed their faces; just as you may have seen it clinging to beets and carrots, when pulled out of their native soil. Cadmus hardly knew whether to consider them as men, or some odd kind of vegetable; although, on the whole, he concluded that there was human nature in them, because they were so fond of trumpets and weapons, and so ready to shed blood.\n\nThey looked him earnestly in the face, waiting for his next order, and evidently desiring no other employment than to follow him from one battlefield to another, all over the wide world. But Cadmus was wiser than these earth-born creatures, with the dragon's fierceness in them, and knew better how to use their strength and hardihood.\n\n\"Come!\" said he. \"You are sturdy fellows. Make yourselves useful! Quarry some stones with those great swords of yours, and help me to build a city.\"\n\nThe five soldiers grumbled a little, and muttered that it was their business to overthrow cities, not to build them up. But Cadmus looked at them with a stern eye, and spoke to them in a tone of authority, so that they knew him for their master, and never again thought of disobeying his commands. They set to work in good earnest, and toiled so diligently, that, in a very short time, a city began to make its appearance. At first, to be sure, the workmen showed a quarrelsome disposition. Like savage beasts, they would doubtless have done one another a mischief, if Cadmus had not kept watch over them, and quelled the fierce old serpent that lurked in their hearts, when he saw it gleaming out of their wild eyes. But, in course of time, they got accustomed to honest labor, and had sense enough to feel that there was more true enjoyment in living at peace, and doing good to one's neighbor, than in striking at him with a two-edged sword. It may not be too much to hope that the rest of mankind will by and by grow as wise and peaceable as these five earth-begrimed warriors, who sprang from the dragon's teeth.\n\nAnd now the city was built, and there was a home in it for each of the workmen. But the palace of Cadmus was not yet erected, because they had left it till the last, meaning to introduce all the new improvements of architecture, and make it very commodious, as well as stately and beautiful. After finishing the rest of their labors, they all went to bed betimes, in order to rise in the gray of the morning, and get at least the foundation of the edifice laid before nightfall. But, when Cadmus arose, and took his way towards the site where the palace was to be built, followed by his five sturdy workmen marching all in a row, what do you think he saw?\n\nWhat should it be but the most magnificent palace that had ever been seen in the world. It was built of marble and other beautiful kinds of stone, and rose high into the air, with a splendid dome and a portico along the front, and carved pillars, and everything else that befitted the habitation of a mighty king. It had grown up out of the earth in almost as short a time as it had taken the armed host to spring from the dragon's teeth; and what made the matter more strange, no seed of this stately edifice ever had been planted.\n\nWhen the five workmen beheld the dome, with the morning sunshine making it look golden and glorious, they gave a great shout.\n\n\"Long live King Cadmus,\" they cried, \"in his beautiful palace.\"\n\nAnd the new king, with his five faithful followers at his heels, shouldering their pickaxes and marching in a rank (for they still had a soldier-like sort of behavior, as their nature was), ascended the palace steps. Halting at the entrance, they gazed through a long vista of lofty pillars, that were ranged from end to end of a great hall. At the farther extremity of this hall, approaching slowly towards him, Cadmus beheld a female figure, wonderfully beautiful, and adorned with a royal robe, and a crown of diamonds over her golden ringlets, and the richest necklace that ever a queen wore. His heart thrilled with delight. He fancied it his long-lost sister Europa, now grown to womanhood, coming to make him happy, and to repay him with her sweet sisterly affection, for all those weary wonderings in quest of her since he left King Agenor's palace--for the tears that he had shed, on parting with Phoenix, and Cilix, and Thasus--for the heart-breakings that had made the whole world seem dismal to him over his dear mother's grave.\n\nBut, as Cadmus advanced to meet the beautiful stranger, he saw that her features were unknown to him, although, in the little time that it required to tread along the hall, he had already felt a sympathy betwixt himself and her.\n\n\"No, Cadmus,\" said the same voice that had spoken to him in the field of the armed men, \"this is not that dear sister Europa whom you have sought so faithfully all over the wide world. This is Harmonia, a daughter of the sky, who is given you instead of sister, and brothers, and friend, and mother. You will find all those dear ones in her alone.\"\n\nSo King Cadmus dwelt in the palace, with his new friend Harmonia, and found a great deal of comfort in his magnificent abode, but would doubtless have found as much, if not more, in the humblest cottage by the wayside. Before many years went by, there was a group of rosy little children (but how they came thither has always been a mystery to me) sporting in the great hall, and on the marble steps of the palace, and running joyfully to meet King Cadmus when affairs of state left him at leisure to play with them. They called him father, and Queen Harmonia mother. The five old soldiers of the dragon's teeth grew very fond of these small urchins, and were never weary of showing them how to shoulder sticks, flourish wooden swords, and march in military order, blowing a penny trumpet, or beating an abominable rub-a-dub upon a little drum.\n\nBut King Cadmus, lest there should be too much of the dragon's tooth in his children's disposition, used to find time from his kingly duties to teach them their A B C--which he invented for their benefit, and for which many little people, I am afraid, are not half so grateful to him as they ought to be.",

Make ready for the King!”\n\nThe children stopped their play, and looked at one another.\n\n“Did you hear that?” they said. “The King is coming. He may look over the wall and see our playground; who knows? We must put it in order.”\n\nThe playground was sadly dirty, and in the corners were scraps of paper and broken toys, for these were careless children. But now, one brought a hoe, and another a rake, and a third ran to fetch the wheelbarrow from behind the garden gate. They labored hard, till at length all was clean and tidy.\n\n“Now it is clean!” they said; “but we must make it pretty, too, for kings are used to fine things; maybe he would not notice mere cleanness, for he may have it all the time.”\n\nThen one brought sweet rushes and strewed them on the ground; and others made garlands of oak leaves and pine tassels and hung them on the walls; and the littlest one pulled marigold buds and threw them all about the playground, “to look like gold,” he said.\n\nWhen all was done the playground was so beautiful that the children stood and looked at it, and clapped their hands with pleasure.\n\n“Let us keep it always like this!” said the littlest one; and the others cried, “Yes! yes! that is what we will do.”\n\nThey waited all day for the coming of the King, but he never came; only, towards sunset, a man with travel-worn clothes, and a kind, tired face passed along the road, and stopped to look over the wall.\n\n“What a pleasant place!” said the man. “May I come in and rest, dear children?”\n\nThe children brought him in gladly, and set him on the seat that they had made out of an old cask. They had covered it with the old red cloak to make it look like a throne, and it made a very good one.\n\n“It is our playground!” they said. “We made it pretty for the King, but he did not come, and now we mean to keep it so for ourselves.”\n\n“That is good!” said the man.\n\n“Because we think pretty and clean is nicer than ugly and dirty!” said another.\n\n“That is better!” said the man.\n\n“And for tired people to rest in!” said the littlest one.\n\n“That is best of all!” said the man.\n\nHe sat and rested, and looked at the children with such kind eyes that they came about him, and told him all they knew; about the five puppies in the barn, and the thrush’s nest with four blue eggs, and the shore where the gold shells grew; and the man nodded and understood all about it.\n\nBy and by he asked for a cup of water, and they brought it to him in the best cup, with the gold sprigs on it: then he[14] thanked the children, and rose and went on his way; but before he went he laid his hand on their heads for a moment, and the touch went warm to their hearts.\n\nThe children stood by the wall and watched the man as he went slowly along. The sun was setting, and the light fell in long slanting rays across the road.\n\n“He looks so tired!” said one of the children.\n\n“But he was so kind!” said another.\n\n“See!” said the littlest one. “How the sun shines on his hair! it looks like a crown of gold.”",

    "content": "There was once a poor old fisherman, and one year he was not getting much fish. On a day of days, while he was fishing, there rose a sea-maiden at the side of his boat, and she asked him, \"Are you getting much fish?\" The old man answered and said, \"Not I.\" \"What reward would you give me for sending plenty of fish to you?\" \"Ach!\" said the old man, \"I have not much to spare.\" \"Will you give me the first son you have?\" said she. \"I would give ye that, were I to have a son,\" said he. \"Then go home, and remember me when your son is twenty years of age, and you yourself will get plenty of fish after this.\" Everything happened as the sea-maiden said, and he himself got plenty of fish; but when the end of the twenty years was nearing, the old man was growing more and more sorrowful and heavy-hearted, while he counted each day as it came.\n\nHe had rest neither day nor night. The son asked his father one day, \"Is any one troubling you?\" The old man said, \"Some one is, but that's nought to do with you nor any one else.\" The lad said, \"I must know what it is.\" His father told him at last how the matter was with him and the sea-maiden. \"Let not that put you in any trouble,\" said the son; \"I will not oppose you.\" \"You shall not; you shall not go, my son, though I never get fish any more.\" \"If you will not let me go with you, go to the smithy, and let the smith make me a great strong sword, and I will go seek my fortune.\"\n\nHis father went to the smithy, and the smith made a doughty sword for him. His father came home with the sword. The lad grasped it and gave it a shake or two, and it flew into a hundred splinters. He asked his father to go to the smithy and get him another sword in which there should be twice as much weight; and so his father did, and so likewise it happened to the next sword—it broke in two halves. Back went the old man to the smithy; and the smith made a great sword, its like he never made before. \"There's thy sword for thee,\" said the smith, \"and the fist must be good that plays this blade.\" The old man gave the sword to his son; he gave it a shake or two. \"This will do,\" said he; \"it's high time now to travel on my way.\"\n\nOn the next morning he put a saddle on a black horse that his father had, and he took the world for his pillow. When he went on a bit, he fell in with the carcass of a sheep beside the road. And there were a great black dog, a falcon, and an otter, and they were quarrelling over the spoil. So they asked him to divide it for them. He came down off the horse and he divided the carcass amongst the three. Three shares to the dog, two shares to the otter, and a share to the falcon. \"For this,\" said the dog, \"if swiftness of foot or sharpness of tooth will give thee aid, mind me, and I will be at thy side.\" Said the otter, \"If the swimming of foot on the ground of a pool will loose thee, mind me, and I will be at thy side.\" Said the falcon, \"If hardship comes on thee, where swiftness of wing or crook of claw will do good, mind me, and I will be at thy side.\"\n\nOn this he went onward till he reached a king's house, and he took service to be a herd, and his wages were to be according to the milk of the cattle. He went away with the cattle, and the grazing was but bare. In the evening when he took them home they had not much milk, the place was so bare, and his meat and drink was but spare that night.\n\nOn the next day he went on further with them; and at last he came to a place exceedingly grassy, in a green glen, of which he never saw the like.\n\nBut about the time when he should drive the cattle homewards, who should he see coming but a great giant with a sword in his hand? \"Hi! Ho!! Ho-garach!!!\" says the giant. \"Those cattle are mine; they are on my land, and a dead man art thou.\" \"I say not that,\" says the herd; \"there is no knowing, but that may be easier to say than to do.\"\n\nHe drew the great clean-sweeping sword, and he neared the giant. The herd drew back his sword, and the head was off the giant in a twinkling. He leaped on the black horse, and he went to look for the giant's house. In went the herd, and that's the place where there was money in plenty, and dresses of each kind in the wardrobe with gold and silver, and each thing finer than the other. At the mouth of night he took himself to the king's house, but he took not a thing from the giant's house. And when the cattle were milked this night there was milk. He got good feeding this night, meat and drink without stint, and the king was hugely pleased that he had caught such a herd. He went on for a time in this way, but at last the glen grew bare of grass, and the grazing was not so good.\n\nSo he thought he would go a little further forward in on the giant's land; and he sees a great park of grass. He returned for the cattle, and he put them into the park.\n\nThey were but a short time grazing in the park when a great wild giant came full of rage and madness. \"Hi! Haw!! Hogaraich!!!\" said the giant. \"It is a drink of thy blood that will quench my thirst this night.\" \"There is no knowing,\" said the herd, \"but that's easier to say than to do.\" And at each other went the men. There was shaking of blades! At length and at last it seemed as if the giant would get the victory over the herd. Then he called on the dog, and with one spring the black dog caught the giant by the neck, and swiftly the herd struck off his head.\n\nHe went home very tired this night, but it's a wonder if the king's cattle had not milk. The whole family was delighted that they had got such a herd.\n\nNext day he betakes himself to the castle. When he reached the door, a little flattering carlin met him standing in the door. \"All hail and good luck to thee, fisher's son; 'tis I myself am pleased to see thee; great is the honour for this kingdom, for thy like to be come into it—thy coming in is fame for this little bothy; go in first; honour to the gentles; go on, and take breath.\"\n\n\"In before me, thou crone; I like not flattery out of doors; go in and let's hear thy speech.\" In went the crone, and when her back was to him he drew his sword and whips her head off; but the sword flew out of his hand. And swift the crone gripped her head with both hands, and puts it on her neck as it was before. The dog sprang on the crone, and she struck the generous dog with the club of magic; and there he lay. But the herd struggled for a hold of the club of magic, and with one blow on the top of the head she was on earth in the twinkling of an eye. He went forward, up a little, and there was spoil! Gold and silver, and each thing more precious than another, in the crone's castle. He went back to the king's house, and there was rejoicing.\n\nHe followed herding in this way for a time; but one night after he came home, instead of getting \"All hail\" and \"good luck\" from the dairymaid, all were at crying and woe.\n\nHe asked what cause of woe there was that night. The dairymaid said, \"There is a great beast with three heads in the loch, and it must get some one every year, and the lot had come this year on the[163] king's daughter, and at midday to-morrow she is to meet the Laidly Beast at the upper end of the loch, but there is a great suitor yonder who is going to rescue her.\"\n\n\"What suitor is that?\" said the herd. \"Oh, he is a great General of arms,\" said the dairymaid, \"and when he kills the beast, he will marry the king's daughter, for the king has said that he who could save his daughter should get her to marry.\"\n\nThe Sea-Maiden-1But on the morrow, when the time grew near, the king's daughter and this hero of arms went to give a meeting to the beast, and they reached the black rock, at the upper end of the loch. They were but a short time there when the beast stirred in the midst of the loch; but when the General saw this terror of a beast with three heads, he took fright, and he slunk away, and he hid himself. And the king's daughter was under fear and under trembling, with no one at all to save her. Suddenly she sees a doughty handsome youth, riding a black horse, and coming where she was. He was marvellously arrayed and full armed, and his black dog moved after him. \"There is gloom on your face, girl,\" said the youth; \"what do you here?\"\n\n\"Oh! that's no matter,\" said the king's daughter. \"It's not long I'll be here at all events.\"\n\n—\"I say not that,\" said he.\n\n\"A champion fled as likely as you, and not long since,\" said she.\n\n\"He is a champion who stands the war,\" said the youth. And to meet the beast he went with his sword and his dog. But there was a spluttering and a splashing between himself and the beast! The dog kept doing all he might, and the king's daughter was palsied by fear of the noise of the beast! One of them would now be under, and now above. But at last he cut one of the heads off it. It gave one roar, and the son of earth, echo of the rocks, called to its screech, and it drove the loch in spindrift from end to end, and in a twinkling it went out of sight.\n\n\"Good luck and victory follow you, lad!\" said the king's daughter. \"I am safe for one night, but the beast will come again and again, until the other two heads come off it.\" He caught the beast's head, and he drew a knot through it, and he told her to bring it with her there to-morrow. She gave him a gold ring, and went home with the head on her shoulder, and the herd betook himself to the cows. But she had not gone far when this great General saw her, and he said to her, \"I will kill you if you do not say 'twas I took the head off the beast.\" \"Oh!\" says she, \"'tis I will say it; who else took the head off the beast but you!\" They reached the king's house, and the head was on the General's shoulder. But here was rejoicing, that she should come home alive and whole, and this great captain with the beast's head full of blood in hand. On the morrow they went away, and there was no question at all but that this hero would save the king's daughter.\n\nThey reached the same place, and they were not long there when the fearful Laidly Beast stirred in the midst of the loch, and the hero slunk away as he did on yesterday, but it was not long after this when the man of the black horse came, with another dress on. No matter; she knew that it was the very same lad. \"It is I am pleased to see you,\" said she. \"I am in hopes you will handle your great sword to-day as you did yesterday. Come up and take breath.\" But they were not long there when they saw the beast steaming in the midst of the loch.\n\nThe Sea-Maiden 2At once he went to meet the beast, but there was Cloopersteich and Claperstich, spluttering, splashing, raving, and roaring on the beast! They kept at it thus for a long time, and about the mouth of the night he cut another head off the beast. He put it on the knot and gave it to her. She gave him one of her earrings, and he leaped on the black horse, and he betook himself to the herding. The king's daughter went home with the heads. The General met her, and took the heads from her, and he said to her that she must tell that it was he who took the head off the beast this time also. \"Who else took the head off the beast but you?\" said she. They reached the king's house with the heads. Then there was joy and gladness.\n\nAbout the same time on the morrow, the two went away. The officer hid himself as he usually did. The king's daughter betook herself to the bank of the loch. The hero of the black horse came, and if roaring and raving were on the beast on the days that were passed, this day it was horrible. But no matter, he took the third head off the beast, and drew it through the knot, and gave it to her. She gave him her other earring, and then she went home with the heads. When they reached the king's house, all were full of smiles, and the General was to marry the king's daughter the next day. The wedding was going on, and every one about the castle longing till the priest should come. But when the priest came, she would marry only the one who could take the heads off the knot without cutting it. \"Who should take the heads off the knot but the man that put the heads on?\" said the king.\n\nThe General tried them, but he could not loose them, and at last there was no one about the house but had tried to take the heads off the knot, but they could not. The king asked if there were any one else about the house that would try to take the heads off the knot. They said that the herd had not tried them yet. Word went for the herd; and he was not long throwing them hither and thither. \"But stop a bit, my lad,\" said the king's daughter; \"the man that took the heads off the beast, he has my ring and my two earrings.\" The herd put his hand in his pocket, and he threw them on the board. \"Thou art my man,\" said the king's daughter. The king was not so pleased when he saw that it was a herd who was to marry his daughter, but he ordered that he should be put in a better dress; but his daughter spoke, and she said that he had a dress as fine as any that ever was in his castle; and thus it happened. The herd put on the giant's golden dress, and they married that same day.\n\nThey were now married, and everything went on well. But one day, and it was the namesake of the day when his father had promised him to the sea-maiden, they were sauntering by the side of the loch, and lo and behold! she came and took him away to the loch without leave or asking. The king's daughter was now mournful, tearful, blind-sorrowful for her married man; she was always with her eye on the loch. An old soothsayer met her, and she told how it had befallen her married mate. Then he told her the thing to do to save her mate, and that she did.\n\nShe took her harp to the sea-shore, and sat and played; and the sea-maiden came up to listen, for sea-maidens are fonder of music than all other creatures. But when the wife saw the sea-maiden she stopped. The sea-maiden said, \"Play on!\" but the princess said, \"No, not till I see my man again.\" So the sea-maiden put up his head out of the loch. Then the princess played again, and stopped till the sea-maiden put him up to the waist. Then the princess played and stopped again, and this time the sea-maiden put him all out of the loch, and he called on the falcon and became one and flew on shore. But the sea-maiden took the princess, his wife.\n\nSorrowful was each one that was in the town on this night. Her man was mournful, tearful, wandering down and up about the banks of the loch, by day and night. The old soothsayer met him. The soothsayer told him that there was no way of killing the sea-maiden but the one way, and this is it—\"In the island that is in the midst of the loch is the white-footed hind of the slenderest legs and the swiftest step, and though she be caught, there will spring a hoodie out of her, and though the hoodie should be caught, there will spring a trout out of her, but there is an egg in the mouth of the trout, and the soul of the sea-maiden is in the egg and if the egg breaks she is dead.\"\n\nNow, there was no way of getting to this island, for the sea-maiden would sink each boat and raft that would go on the loch. He thought he would try to leap the strait with the black horse, and even so he did. The black horse leaped the strait. He saw the hind, and he let the black dog after her, but when he was on one side of the island, the hind would be on the other side. \"Oh! would the black dog of the carcass of flesh were here!\" No sooner spoke he the word than the grateful dog was at his side; and after the hind he went, and they were not long in bringing her to earth. But he no sooner caught her than a hoodie sprang out of her. \"Would that the falcon grey, of sharpest eye and swiftest wing were here!\" No sooner said he this than the falcon was after the hoodie, and she was not long putting her to earth; and as the hoodie fell on the bank of the loch, out of her jumps the trout. \"Oh! that thou wert by me now, oh otter!\" No sooner said than the otter was at his side, and out on the loch she leaped, and brings the trout from the midst of the loch; but no sooner was the otter on shore with the trout than the egg came from his mouth; He sprang and he put his foot on it. 'Twas then the sea-maiden appeared, and she said, \"Break not the egg, and you shall get all you ask.\" \"Deliver to me my wife!\" In the wink of an eye she was by his side. When he got hold of her hand in both his hands, he let his foot down on the egg and the sea-maiden died.",

    "content": "Little Boy Blue, come blow your horn.\nThe sheep 's in the meadow, the cow 's in the corn;\nWhere 's the little boy that minds the sheep?\nHe 's under the haystack, fast asleep!\n\nThere once lived a poor widow who supported herself and her only son by gleaning in the fields the stalks of grain that had been missed by the reapers. Her little cottage was at the foot of a beautiful valley, upon the edge of the river that wound in and out among the green hills; and although poor, she was contented with her lot, for her home was pleasant and her lovely boy was a constant delight to her.\n\nHe had big blue eyes, and fair golden curls, and he loved his good mother very dearly, and was never more pleased than when she allowed him to help her with her work.\n\nAnd so the years passed happily away till the boy was eight years old, but then the widow fell sick, and their little store of money melted gradually away.\n\n\"I do n't know what we shall do for bread,\" she said, kissing her boy with tears in her eyes, \"for I am not yet strong enough to work, and we have no money left.\"\n\n\"But I can work,\" answered the boy; \"and I 'm sure if I go to the Squire up at the Hall he will give me something to do.\"\n\nAt first the widow was reluctant to consent to this, since she loved to keep her child at her side, but finally, as nothing else could be done, she decided to let him go to see the Squire.\n\nBeing too proud to allow her son to go to the great house in his ragged clothes, she made him a new suit out of a pretty blue dress she had herself worn in happier times, and when it was finished and the boy dressed in it, he looked as pretty as a prince in a fairy tale. For the bright blue jacket set off his curls to good advantage, and the color just matched the blue of his eyes. His trousers were blue, also, and she took the silver buckles from her own shoes and put them on his, that he might appear the finer. And then she brushed his curls and placed his big straw hat upon them and sent him away with a kiss to see the Squire.\n\nIt so happened that the great man was walking in his garden with his daughter Madge that morning, and was feeling in an especially happy mood, so that when he suddenly looked up and saw a little boy before him, he said, kindly,\n\n\"Well, my child, what can I do for you?\"\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" said the boy, bravely, although he was frightened at meeting the Squire face to face, \"I want you to give me some work to do, so that I can earn money.\"\n\n\"Earn money!\" repeated the Squire, \"why do you wish to earn money?\"\n\n\"To buy food for my mother, sir. We are very poor, and since she is no longer able to work for me I wish to work for her.\"\n\n\"But what can you do?\" asked the Squire; \"you are too small to work in the fields.\"\n\n\"I could earn something, sir, could n't I?\"\n\nHis tone was so pleading that mistress Madge was unable to resist it, and even the Squire was touched. The young lady came forward and took the boy's hand in her own, and pressing back his curls, she kissed his fair cheek.\n\n\"You shall be our shepherd,\" she said, pleasantly, \"and keep the sheep out of the meadows and the cows from getting in to the corn. You know, father,\" she continued, turning to the Squire, \"it was only yesterday you said you must get a boy to tend the sheep, and this little boy can do it nicely.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied the Squire, \"it shall be as you say, and if he is attentive and watchful he will be able to save me a good bit of trouble and so really earn his money.\"\n\nThen he turned to the child and said,\n\n\"Come to me in the morning, my little man, and I will give you a silver horn to blow, that you may call the sheep and the cows whenever they go astray. What is your name?\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind his name, papa!\" broke in the Squire's daughter; \"I shall call him Little Boy Blue, since he is dressed in blue from head to foot, and his dress but matches his eyes. And you must give him a good wage, also, for surely no Squire before ever had a prettier shepherd boy than this.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the Squire, cheerfully, as he pinched his daughter's rosy cheek; \"be watchful, Little Boy Blue, and you shall be well paid.\"\n\nThen Little Boy Blue thanked them both very sweetly and ran back over the hill and into the valley where his home lay nestled by the riverside, to tell the good news to his mother.\n\nThe poor widow wept tears of joy when she heard his story, and smiled when he told her that his name was to be Little Boy Blue. She knew the Squire was a kind master and would be good to her darling son.\n\nEarly the next morning Little Boy Blue was at the Hall, and the Squire's steward gave him a new silver horn, that glistened brightly in the sunshine, and a golden cord to fasten it around his neck. And then he was given charge of the sheep and the cows, and told to keep them from straying into the meadowlands and the fields of grain.\n\nIt was not hard work, but just suited to Little Boy Blue's age, and he was watchful and vigilant and made a very good shepherd boy indeed. His mother needed food no longer, for the Squire paid her son liberally, and the Squire's daughter made a favorite of the small shepherd and loved to hear the call of his silver horn echoing amongst the hills. Even the sheep and the cows were fond of him, and always obeyed the sound of his horn; therefore the Squire's corn thrived finely, and was never trampled.\n\nLittle Boy Blue was now very happy, and his mother was proud and contented and began to improve in health. After a few weeks she became strong enough to leave the cottage and walk a little in the fields each day; but she could not go far, because her limbs were too feeble to support her long, so the most she could attempt was to walk as far as the stile to meet Little Boy Blue as he came home from work in the evening. Then she would lean on his shoulder and return to the cottage with him, and the boy was very glad he could thus support his darling mother and assist her faltering steps.\n\nBut one day a great misfortune came upon them, since it is true that no life can be so happy but that sorrow will creep in to temper it.\n\nLittle Boy Blue came homeward one evening very light of heart and whistled merrily as he walked, for he thought he should find his mother awaiting him at the stile and a good supper spread upon the table in the little cottage. But when he came to the stile his mother was not in sight, and in answer to his call a low moan of pain reached his ears.\n\nLittle Boy Blue sprang over the stile and found lying upon the ground his dear mother, her face white and drawn with suffering, and tears of anguish running down her cheeks. For she had slipped upon the stile and fallen, and her leg was broken!\n\nLittle Boy Blue ran to the cottage for water and bathed the poor woman's face, and raised her head that she might drink. There were no neighbors, for the cottage stood all alone by the river, so the child was obliged to support his mother in his arms as best he could while she crawled painfully back to the cottage. Fortunately, it was not far, and at last she was safely laid upon her bed. Then Little Boy Blue began to think what he should do next.\n\n\"Can I leave you alone while I go for the doctor, mamma?\" he asked, anxiously, as he held her clasped hands tightly in his two little ones. His mother drew him towards her and kissed him.\n\n\"Take the boat, dear,\" she said, \"and fetch the doctor from the village. I shall be patient till you return.\"\n\nLittle Boy Blue rushed away to the river bank and unfastened the little boat; and then he pulled sturdily down the river until he passed the bend and came to the pretty village below. When he had found the doctor and told of his mother's misfortune, the good man promised to attend him at once, and very soon they were seated in the boat and on their way to the cottage.\n\nIt was very dark by this time, but Little Boy Blue knew every turn and bend in the river, and the doctor helped him pull at the oars, so that at last they came to the place where a faint light twinkled through the cottage window. They found the poor woman in much pain, but the doctor quickly set and bandaged her leg, and gave her some medicine to ease her suffering. It was nearly midnight when all was finished and the doctor was ready to start back to the village.\n\n\"Take good care of your mother,\" he said to the boy, \"and do n't worry about her, for it is not a bad break and the leg will mend nicely in time; but she will be in bed many days, and you must nurse her as well as you are able.\"\n\nAll through the night the boy sat by the bedside, bathing his mother's fevered brow and ministering to her wants. And when the day broke she was resting easily and the pain had left her, and she told Little Boy Blue he must go to his work.\n\n\"For,\" said she, \"more than ever now we need the money you earn from the Squire, as my misfortune will add to the expenses of living, and we have the doctor to pay. Do not fear to leave me, for I shall rest quietly and sleep most of the time while you are away.\"\n\nLittle Boy Blue did not like to leave his mother all alone, but he knew of no one he could ask to stay with her; so he placed food and water by her bedside, and ate a little breakfast himself, and started off to tend his sheep.\n\nThe sun was shining brightly, and the birds sang sweetly in the trees, and the crickets chirped just as merrily as if this great trouble had not come to Little Boy Blue to make him sad.\n\nBut he went bravely to his work, and for several hours he watched carefully; and the men at work in the fields, and the Squire's daughter, who sat embroidering upon the porch of the great house, heard often the sound of his horn as he called the straying sheep to his side.\n\nBut he had not slept the whole night, and he was tired with his long watch at his mother's bedside, and so in spite of himself the lashes would droop occasionally over his blue eyes, for he was only a child, and children feel the loss of sleep more than older people.\n\nStill, Little Boy Blue had no intention of sleeping while he was on duty, and bravely fought against the drowsiness that was creeping over him. The sun shone very hot that day, and he walked to the shady side of a big haystack and sat down upon the ground, leaning his back against the stack.\n\nThe cows and sheep were quietly browsing near him, and he watched them earnestly for a time, listening to the singing of the birds, and the gentle tinkling of the bells upon the wethers, and the faraway songs of the reapers that the breeze brought to his ears.\n\nAnd before he knew it the blue eyes had closed fast, and the golden head lay back upon the hay, and Little Boy Blue was fast asleep and dreaming that his mother was well again and had come to the stile to meet him.\n\nThe sheep strayed near the edge of the meadow and paused, waiting for the warning sound of the horn. And the breeze carried the fragrance of the growing corn to the nostrils of the browsing cows and tempted them nearer and nearer to the forbidden feast. But the silver horn was silent, and before long the cows were feeding upon the Squire's pet cornfield and the sheep were enjoying themselves amidst the juicy grasses of the meadows.\n\nThe Squire himself was returning from a long, weary ride over his farms, and when he came to the cornfield and saw the cows trampling down the grain and feeding upon the golden stalks he was very angry.\n\n\"Little Boy Blue!\" he cried; \"ho! Little Boy Blue, come blow your horn!\" But there was no reply. He rode on a way and now discovered that the sheep were deep within the meadows, and that made him more angry still.\n\n\"Here, Isaac,\" he said to a farmer's lad who chanced to pass by, \"where is Little Boy Blue?\"\n\n\"He 's under the haystack, your honor, fast asleep!\" replied Isaac with a grin, for he had passed that way and seen that the boy was lying asleep.\n\n\"Will you go and wake him?\" asked the Squire; \"for he must drive out the sheep and the cows before they do more damage.\"\n\n\"Not I,\" replied Isaac, \"if I wake him he 'll surely cry, for he is but a baby, and not fit to mind the sheep. But I myself will drive them out for your honor,\" and away he ran to do so, thinking that now the Squire would give him Little Boy Blue's place, and make him the shepherd boy, for Isaac had long coveted the position.\n\nThe Squire's daughter, hearing the angry tones of her father's voice, now came out to see what was amiss, and when she heard that Little Boy Blue had failed in his trust she was deeply grieved, for she had loved the child for his pretty ways.\n\nThe Squire dismounted from his horse and came to where the boy was lying.\n\n\"Awake!\" said he, shaking him by the shoulder, \"and depart from my lands, for you have betrayed my trust, and let the sheep and the cows stray into the fields and meadows!\"\n\nLittle Boy Blue started up at once and rubbed his eyes; and then he did as Isaac prophesied, and began to weep bitterly, for his heart was sore that he had failed in his duty to the good Squire and so forfeited his confidence.\n\nBut the Squire's daughter was moved by the child's tears, so she took him upon her lap and comforted him, asking,\n\n\"Why did you sleep, Little Boy Blue, when you should have watched the cows and the sheep?\"\n\n\"My mother has broken her leg,\" answered the boy, between his sobs, \"and I did not sleep all last night, but sat by her bedside nursing her. And I tried hard not to fall asleep, but could not help myself; and oh, Squire! I hope you will forgive me this once, for my poor mother's sake!\"\n\n\"Where does your mother live?\" asked the Squire, in a kindly tone, for he had already forgiven Little Boy Blue.\n\n\"In the cottage down by the river,\" answered the child; \"and she is all alone, for there is no one near to help us in our trouble.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Mistress Madge, rising to her feet and taking his hand; \"lead us to your home, and we will see if we cannot assist your poor mother.\"\n\nSo the Squire and his daughter and Little Boy Blue all walked down to the little cottage, and the Squire had a long talk with the poor widow. And that same day a big basket of dainties was sent to the cottage, and Mistress Madge bade her own maid go to the widow and nurse her carefully until she recovered.\n\nSo that after all Little Boy Blue did more for his dear mother by falling asleep than he could had he kept wide awake; for after his mother was well again the Squire gave them a pretty cottage to live in very near to the great house itself, and the Squire's daughter was ever afterward their good friend, and saw that they wanted for no comforts of life.\n\nAnd Little Boy Blue did not fall asleep again at his post, but watched the cows and the sheep faithfully for many years, until he grew up to manhood and had a farm of his own.\n\nHe always said his mother's accident had brought him good luck, but I think it was rather his own loving heart and his devotion to his mother that made him friends. For no one is afraid to trust a boy who loves to serve and care for his mother.",

    "content": "\"Then is little Benjamin their ruler.\"\n\n\"I think the kitty wants to come in,\" said Mother Golden. \"I hear him crying somewhere. Won't you go and let him in, Adam?\"\n\nAdam laid down his book and went out; the whole family looked up cheerfully, expecting to see Aladdin, the great Maltese cat, enter with his stately port. There was a pause; then Adam came back with a white, scared face, and looked at his father without speaking.\n\n\"What is the matter, my son?\" asked Father Golden.\n\n\"Is Kitty hurt?\" asked Mother Golden, anxiously.\n\n\"Was it that dog of Jackson's?\" cried Lemuel, Mary, Ruth, and Joseph.\n\n\"The cat isn't there!\" said Adam. \"It's--it's a basket, father.\"\n\n\"A basket? What does the boy mean?\"\n\n\"A long basket, with something white inside; and--it's crying!\"\n\nThe boy had left the door open, and at this moment a sound came through it, a long, low, plaintive cry.\n\n\"My heart!\" said Mother Golden; and she was out of the door in a flash.\n\n\"See there now!\" said Father Golden, reprovingly. \"Your mother's smarter than any of you to-day. Go and help her, some of you!\"\n\nThe children tumbled headlong toward the door, but were met by Mother Golden returning, bearing in her strong arms a long basket, in which was indeed something white and fluffy that cried.\n\n\"A baby!\" exclaimed Father Golden.\n\n\"A baby!\" echoed Mary, Lemuel, Ruth, and Joseph.\n\n\"Well, I knew it was a baby,\" protested Adam; \"but I didn't like to say so.\"\n\nMother Golden lifted the child out and held it in a certain way; the cries ceased, and the little creature nestled close against her and looked up in her face.\n\n\"My heart!\" said Mother Golden again. \"Come here, girls!\"\n\nThe girls pressed forward eagerly; the boys hung back, and glanced at their father; these were women's matters.\n\n\"It's got hair!\" cried Ruth, in rapture. \"Mother! real hair, and it curls; see it curl!\"\n\n\"Look at its little hands!\" murmured Mary. \"They're like pink shells, only soft. Oh! see it move them, Ruth!\" She caught her sister's arm in a sudden movement of delight.\n\n\"Oh, mother, mayn't we keep it?\" cried both girls at once.\n\nMother Golden was examining the baby's clothes.\n\n\"Cambric slip, fine enough, but not so terrible fine. Flannel blanket, machine-embroidered--stop! here's a note.\"\n\nShe opened a folded paper, and read a few words, written in a carefully rough hand.\n\n\"His mother is dead, his father a waif. Ask the woman with the kind eyes to take care of him, for Christ's sake.\"\n\n\"My heart!\" said Mother Golden, again.\n\n\"It's a boy, then!\" said Father Golden, brightening perceptibly. He came forward, the boys edging forward too, encouraged by another masculine presence.\n\n\"It's a boy, and a beauty!\" said Mother Golden, wiping her eyes. \"I never see a prettier child. Poor mother, to have to go and leave him. Father, what do you say?\"\n\n\"It's for you to say, mother;\" said Father Golden. \"It's to you the child was sent.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose 'twas me that was meant? They might have mistaken the house.\"\n\n\"Don't talk foolishness!\" said Father Golden. \"The question is, what shall we do with it? There's places, a plenty, where foundlings have the best of bringing up; and you've got care enough, as it is, mother, without taking on any more.\"\n\n\"Oh! we could help!\" cried Mary. \"I could wash and dress it, I know I could, and I'd just love to.\"\n\n\"So could I!\" said twelve-year-old Ruth. \"We'd take turns, Mary and I. Do let's keep it, mother!\"\n\n\"It's a great responsibility!\" said Father Golden.\n\n\"Great Jemima!\" said Mother Golden, with a sniff. \"If I couldn't take the responsibility of a baby, I'd give up.\"\n\nFather Golden's mind moved slowly, and while he was meditating a reply, his wife issued various commands, and went through some intricate feminine manoeuvres, with the effect of increased fluffiness on the baby's part. In five minutes she was feeding the child with warm milk from a spoon, and proclaiming that he ate \"like a Major!\"\n\nThe boys, gaining more and more confidence, were now close at her knee, and watched the process with eager eyes.\n\n\"He's swallering like anything!\" cried Lemuel. \"I can see him do it with his throat, same as anybody.\"\n\n\"See him grab the spoon!\" said Joseph. \"My! ain't he strong? Can he talk, mother?\"\n\n\"Joe, you chuckle-head!\" said Adam, who was sixteen, and knew most things. \"How can he talk, when he hasn't got any teeth?\"\n\n\"Uncle 'Rastus hasn't got any teeth,\" retorted Joseph, \"and he talks like a buzz-saw.\"\n\n\"Hush, Joseph!\" said Mother Golden, reprovingly. \"Your Uncle 'Rastus is a man of years.\"\n\n\"Yes, mother!\" said Joseph, meekly.\n\n\"Baby has got a tooth, too, Adam!\" Mother Golden continued, triumphantly. \"I feel it pricking through the gum this minute. And he so good, and laughing like a sunflower! Did it hurt him, then, a little precious man? he shall have a nice ring to-morrow day, to bitey on, so he shall!\"\n\n\"I suppose, then, he must be as much as a week old,\" hazarded Adam, in an offhand tone. \"They are never born with teeth, are they, unless they are going to be Richard the Thirds, or something wonderful?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he is!\" said Ruth. \"He looks wonderful enough for Richard the Twentieth, or anything.\"\n\nBut--\"A week old!\" said Mother Golden. \"It's time there was a baby in this house, if you don't know better than that, Adam. About six months old I call him, and as pretty a child as ever I saw, even my own.\"\n\nShe looked half-defiantly at Father Golden, who returned the look with one of mild deprecation.\n\n\"I was only thinking of the care 'twould be to you, mother,\" he said. \"We're bound to make inquiries, and report the case, and so forth; but if nothing comes of that, we might keep the child for a spell, and see how things turn out.\"\n\n\"That's what I was thinking!\" said Mother Golden, eagerly. \"I was thinking anyway, Joel, 'twould be best to keep him through his teething and stomach troubles, and give him a good start in the way of proper food and nursing. At them homes and nurseries, they mean well, but the most of them's young, and they don't understand a child's stomach. It's experience they need, not good-will, I'm well aware. Of course, when Baby begun to be a boy, things might be different. You work hard enough as it is, father, and there's places, no doubt, could do better for him, maybe, than what we could. But--well, seeing whose name he come in, I do feel to see him through his teething.\"\n\n\"Children, what do you say?\" asked Father Golden. \"You're old enough to have your opinion, even the youngest of you.\"\n\n\"Oh, keep him! keep him!\" clamored the three younger children.\n\nAdam and Lemuel exchanged a glance of grave inquiry.\n\n\"I guess he'd better stay, father!\" said Adam.\n\n\"I think so, too!\" said Lemuel; and both gave something like a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Then that's settled,\" said Father Golden, \"saying and supposing that no objection turns up. Next thing is, what shall we call this child?\"\n\nAll eyes were fixed on the baby, who, now full of warm milk, sat throned on Mother Golden's knee, blinking content.\n\nIt was a pretty picture: the rosy, dimpled creature, the yellow floss ruffled all over his head, his absurd little mouth open in a beaming smile; beaming above him, Mother Golden's placid face in its frame of silver hair; fronting them, Father Golden in his big leather chair, solid, comfortable, benevolent; and the five children, their honest, sober faces lighted up with unusual excitement. A pleasant, homelike picture. Nothing remarkable in the way of setting; the room, with its stuffed chairs, its tidies, and cabinet organ, was only unlike other such rooms from the fact that Mother Golden habitually sat in it; she could keep even haircloth from being commonplace. But now, all the light in the room seemed to centre on the yellow flossy curls against her breast.\n\n\"A-goo!\" said the baby, in a winning gurgle.\n\n\"He says his name's Goo!\" announced Joseph.\n\n\"Don't be a chuckle-head, Joe!\" said Adam. \"What was the name on the paper, mother?\"\n\n\"It said 'his father is a Waif;' but I don't take that to be a Christian name. Surname, more likely, shouldn't you say, father?\"\n\n\"Not a Christian name, certainly,\" said Father Golden. \"Not much of a name anyhow, 'pears to me. We'd better give the child a suitable name, mother, saying and supposing no objection turns up. Coming into a Christian family, let him have Christian baptism, I say.\"\n\n\"Oh, call him Arthur!\"\n\n\"Bill!\"\n\n\"Richard!\"\n\n\"Charlie!\"\n\n\"Reginald!\" cried the children in chorus.\n\n\"I do love a Bible name!\" said Mother Golden, pensively. \"It gives a child a good start, so to say, and makes him think when he hears himself named, or ought so to do. All our own children has Bible names, father; don't let us cut the little stranger off from his privilege.\"\n\n\"But Bible names are so ugly!\" objected Lemuel, who was sensitive, and suffered under his own cognomen.\n\n\"Son,\" said Father Golden, \"your mother chooses the names in this family.\"\n\n\"Yes, father!\" said Lemuel.\n\n\"Lemuel, dear, you was named for a king!\" said Mother Golden. \"He was a good boy to his mother, and so are you. Bring the Bible, and let us see what it opens at. Joseph, you are the youngest, you shall open it.\"\n\nJoseph opened the great brown leather Bible, and closing his eyes, laid his hand on the page; then looking down, he read:\n\n\"'There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah their council: the princes of Zebulun and the princes of Nephtali.'\"\n\n\"Zebulun and Nephtali are outlandish-sounding names,\" said Mother Golden.\n\n\"I never knew but one Nephtali, and he squinted. Benjamin shall be this child's name. Little Benjamin: the Lord bless and keep him!\"\n\n\"Amen!\" said Father Golden.\n\nPART II.\n\n\"Father, may I come in, if you are not busy?\"\n\nIt was Mary who spoke; Mary, the dear eldest daughter, now a woman grown, grave and mild, trying hard to fill the place left empty these two years, since Mother Golden went smiling out of life.\n\nFather Golden looked up from his book; he was an old man now, but his eyes were still young and kind.\n\n\"What is it, daughter Mary?\"\n\n\"The same old story, father dear; Benny in mischief again. This time he has rubbed soot on all the door-handles, and the whole house is black with it. I hate to trouble you, father, but I expect you'll have to speak to him. I do love the child so, I'm not strict enough--I'm ashamed to say it, but they all think so, and I know it's true--and Adam is too strict.\"\n\n\"Yes, Adam is too strict,\" said Father Golden. He looked at a portrait that stood on his desk, a framed photograph of Mother Golden.\n\n\"I'll speak to the child, Mary,\" he said. \"I'll see that this does not happen again. What is it, Ruthie?\"\n\n\"I was looking for Mary, father. I wanted--oh, Mary! what shall I do with Benny? he has tied Rover and the cat together by their tails, and they are rushing all about the garden almost crazy. I must finish this work, so I can't attend to it. He says he is playing Samson. I wish you would speak to him, father.\"\n\n\"I will do so, Ruth, I will do so. Don't be distressed, my daughter.\"\n\n\"But he is so naughty, father! he is so different from the other boys. Joe never used to play such tricks when he was little.\"\n\n\"The spring vacation will be over soon now, Ruth,\" said Sister Mary. \"He is always better when he is at work, and there is so little for a boy to do just at this time of year.\"\n\n\"I left Joe trying to catch the poor creatures,\" said Ruth. \"Here he comes now.\"\n\nJoe, a tall lad of seventeen, entered with a face of tragedy.\n\n\"Any harm done, Joseph?\" asked Father Golden, glancing at the portrait on his desk.\n\n\"It's that kid again, father!\" said Joe. \"Poor old Rover--\"\n\n\"Father knows about that, Joe!\" said Mary, gently.\n\n\"Did you get them apart?\" cried Ruth.\n\n\"Yes, I did, but not till they had smashed most of the glass in the kitchen windows, and trampled all over Mary's geraniums. Something has got to be done about that youngster, father. He's getting to be a perfect nuisance.\"\n\n\"I am thinking of doing something about him, son Joseph,\" said Father Golden. \"Are your brothers in the house?\"\n\n\"I think I heard them come in just now, sir. Do you want to see them?\"\n\nApparently Adam and Lemuel wanted to see their father, for they appeared in the doorway at this moment: quiet-looking men, with grave, \"set\" faces; the hair already beginning to edge away from their temples.\n\n\"You are back early from the office, boys!\" said Father Golden.\n\n\"We came as soon as we got the message,\" said Adam. \"I hope nothing is wrong, father.\"\n\n\"What message, Adam?\"\n\n\"Didn't you send for us? Benny came running in, all out of breath, and said you wished to see us at once. If he has been playing tricks again--\"\n\nAdam's grave face darkened into sternness. The trick was too evident.\n\n\"Something must be done about that boy, father!\" he said. \"He is the torment of the whole family.\"\n\n\"No one can live a day in peace!\" said Lemuel.\n\n\"No dumb creature's life is safe!\" said Joe.\n\n\"He breaks everything he lays hands on,\" said Ruth, \"and he won't keep his hands off anything.\"\n\n\"You were all little once, boys!\" said Mary.\n\n\"We never behaved in this kind of way!\" said the brothers, sedate from their cradles. \"Something must be done!\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said Father Golden. \"Something must be done.\"\n\nGlancing once more at the portrait of Mother Golden, he turned and faced his children with grave looks.\n\n\"Sit down, sons and daughters!\" said the old man. \"I have something to say to you.\"\n\nThe young people obeyed, wondering, but not questioning. Father Golden was head of the house.\n\n\"You all come to me,\" said Father Golden, \"with complaints of little Benjamin. It is singular that you should come to-day, for I have been waiting for this day to speak to you about the child myself.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment; then added, weighing his words slowly, as was his wont when much in earnest, \"Ten years ago to-day, that child was left on our door-step.\"\n\nThe brothers and sisters uttered an exclamation, half surprised, half acquiescent.\n\n\"It doesn't seem so long!\" said Adam.\n\n\"It seems longer!\" said Mary.\n\n\"I keep forgetting he came that way!\" murmured Joe.\n\n\"I felt doubtful about taking him in,\" Father Golden went on. \"But your mother wished it; you all wished it. We decided to keep him for a spell, and give him a good start in life, and we have kept him till now.\"\n\n\"Of course we have kept him!\" said Ruth.\n\n\"Naturally!\" said Lemuel.\n\nAdam and Mary said nothing, but looked earnestly at their father.\n\n\"Little Benjamin is now ten years old, more or less,\" said Father Golden. \"You are men and women grown; even Joseph is seventeen. Your mother has entered into the rest that is reserved for the people of God, and I am looking forward in the hope that, not through any merit of mine, but the merciful grace of God, I may soon be called to join her. Adam and Lemuel, you are settled in the business, and looking forward to making homes of your own with worthy young women. Joseph is going to college, which is a new thing in our family, but one I approve, seeing his faculty appears to lie that way. Ruth will make a first-rate dressmaker, I am told by those who know. Mary--\"\n\nHis quiet voice faltered. Mary took his hand and kissed it passionately; a sob broke from her, and she turned her face away from the brothers and sister who loved but did not understand her. They looked at her with grave compassion, but no one would have thought of interrupting Father Golden.\n\n\"Mary, you are the home-maker,\" the old man went on. \"I hope that when I am gone this home will still be here, with you at the head of it. You are your mother's own daughter; there is no more to say.\" He was silent for a time, and then continued.\n\n\"There remains little Benjamin, a child of ten years. He is no kin to us; an orphan, or as good as one; no person has ever claimed him, or ever will. The time has come to decide what shall be done with the child.\"\n\nAgain he paused, and looked around. The serious young faces were all intent upon him; in some, the intentness seemed deepening into trouble, but no one spoke or moved.\n\n\"We have done all that we undertook to do for him, that night we took him in, and more. We have brought him--I should say your mother brought him--through his sickly days; we 'most lost him, you remember, when he was two years old, with the croup--and he is now a healthy, hearty child, and will likely make a strong man. He has been well treated, well fed and clothed, maybe better than he would have been by his own parents if so't had been. He is turning out wild and mischievous, though he has a good heart, none better; and you all, except Mary, come to me with complaints of him.\n\n\"Now, this thing has gone far enough. One of two things: either this boy is to be sent away to some institution, to take his place among other orphans and foundlings, or--he must be one of you for now and always, to share alike with you while I live, to be bore with and helped by each and every one of you as if he was your own blood, and to have his share of the property when I am gone. Sons and daughters, this question is for you to decide. I shall say nothing. My life is 'most over, yours is just beginning. I have no great amount to leave you, but 'twill be comfortable so far as it goes. Benjamin has one-sixth of that, and becomes my own son, to be received and treated by you as your own brother, or he goes.\"\n\nMary hid her face in her hands. Adam walked to the window and looked out; but the other three broke out into a sudden, hurried clamor, strangely at variance with their usual staid demeanor.\n\n\"Oh, father, we couldn't let him go!\"\n\n\"Why, father, I can't think what you mean!\"\n\n\"I'm sure, sir, we never thought of such a thing as sending him away. Why, he's our Ben.\"\n\n\"Good enough little kid, only mischievous.\"\n\n\"Needs a little governing, that's all. Mary spoils him; no harm in him, not a mite.\"\n\n\"And the lovingest little soul! the minute he found that Kitty's paw was cut, he sat down and cried--\"\n\n\"I guess if Benny went, I'd go after him pretty quick!\" said Joseph, who had been loudest in his complaint against the child.\n\nMary looked up and smiled through her tears. \"Joe, your heart is in the right place!\" she said. \"I finished your shirts this morning, dear; I'm going to begin on your slippers to-night.\"\n\n\"Well, but, father--\"\n\n\"Father dear, about little Benny--\"\n\n\"Yes, sir--poor little Ben!\"\n\n\"Go easy!\" said Father Golden; and his face, as he looked from one to the other, was as bright as his name.\n\n\"Why, children, you're real excited. I don't want excitement, nor crying--Mary, daughter, I knew how you would feel, anyway. I want a serious word, 'go,' or 'stay,' from each one of you; a word that will last your lives long. I'll begin with the youngest, because that was your mother's way. She always said the youngest was nearest heaven. Joseph, what is your word about little Benjamin?\"\n\n\"Stay, of course!\" cried Joe. \"Benny does tease me, but I should be nowhere without him.\"\n\n\"Ruth! you seemed greatly tried just now. Think what you are going to say.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course he must stay, father. Why, the child is the life of the house. We are all so humdrum and mopy, I don't know what we should do without Benny to keep us moving.\"\n\n\"Mary, daughter--not that I need your answer, my dear.\"\n\n\"He is the only child I shall ever have!\" said Mary, simply.\n\nThere was silence for a moment, and all thought of the grave where her young heart had laid its treasure.\n\n\"Lemuel!\"\n\n\"I've been hard on the child, Father!\" said Lemuel. \"He's so different from the rest of us, and he does try me. But mother loved him, and down at the bottom we all do, I guess. I say 'stay,' too, and I'll try to be more of a brother to him from now on.\"\n\n\"Son Adam, I have left you the longest time to reflect,\" said Father Golden. \"You are the oldest, and when I am gone it will be on you and Mary that the heft of the care will come. Take all the time you want, and then give us your word!\"\n\nAdam turned round; his face was very grave, but he spoke cheerfully.\n\n\"I have had time enough, Father,\" he said. \"I was the first that heard that little voice, ten years ago, and the first, except mother, that saw the child; 'twould be strange if I were the one to send him away. He came in Christ's name, and in that name I bid him stay.\"\n\n\"Amen!\" said Father Golden.\n\nA silence followed; but it was broken soon by a lively whistle, shrilling out a rollicking tune; the next moment a boy came running into the room. Curly, rosy, dirty, ragged, laughing, panting, little Benjamin stood still and looked round on all the earnest, serious faces.\n\n\"What's the matter, all you folks?\" he asked. \"I should think you was all in meeting, and sermon just beginning. Ruth, I tied up Kitty's leg all right; and I'll dig greens to pay for the glass, Joe. Say, Bro'rer-Adam-an'-Lem (Benny pronounced this as if it were one word), did you forget it was April Fool's Day? Didn't I fool you good? And--say! there's a fierce breeze and my new kite's a buster. Who'll come out and fly her with me?\"\n\n\"I will, Benny!\" said Adam, Lemuel, Mary, Ruth, and Joseph.",

    "content": "There was a miller, who left no more estate to the three sons he had, than his Mill, his Ass, and his Cat. The partition was soon made. Neither the scrivener nor attorney were sent for. They would soon have eaten up all the poor patrimony. The eldest had the Mill, the second the Ass, and the youngest nothing but the Cat.\n\nThe poor young fellow was quite comfortless at having so poor a lot.\n\n\"My brothers,\" said he, \"may get their living handsomely enough, by joining their stocks together; but for my part, when I have eaten up my Cat, and made me a muff of his skin, I must die with hunger.\"\n\nThe Cat, who heard all this, but made as if he did not, said to him with a grave and serious air:\n\n\"Do not thus afflict yourself, my good master; you have only to give me a bag, and get a pair of boots made for me, that I may scamper thro' the dirt and the brambles, and you shall see that you have not so bad a portion of me as you imagine.\"\n\nTho' the Cat's master did not build very much upon what he said, he had however often seen him play a great many cunning tricks to catch rats and mice; as when he used to hang by the heels, or hide himself in the meal, and make[70] as if he were dead; so that he did not altogether despair of his affording him some help in his miserable condition.\n\nWhen the Cat had what he asked for, he booted himself very gallantly; and putting his bag about his neck, he held the strings of it in his two fore paws, and went into a warren where was great abundance of rabbits. He put bran and sow-thistle into his bag, and stretching himself out at length, as if he had been dead, he waited for some young rabbit, not yet acquainted with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage his bag for what he had put into it.\n\nScarce was he lain down, but he had what he wanted; a rash and foolish young rabbit jumped into his bag, and Monsieur Puss, immediately drawing close the strings, took and killed him without pity. Proud of his prey, he went with it to the palace, and asked to speak with his Majesty. He was shewed up stairs into the King's apartment, and, making a low reverence, said to him:\n\n\"I have brought you, sir, a rabbit of the warren which my noble lord the Marquis of Carabas\" (for that was the title which Puss was pleased to give his master) \"has commanded me to present to your Majesty from him.\"\n\n\"Tell thy master,\" said the King, \"that I thank him, and that he does me a great deal of pleasure.\"\n\nAnother time he went and hid himself among some standing corn, holding still his bag open; and when a brace of partridges ran into it, he drew the strings, and so caught them both. He went and made a present of these to the[71] King, as he had done before of the rabbit which he took in the warren. The King in like manner received the partridges with great pleasure, and ordered him some money to drink.\n\nThe Cat continued for two or three months, thus to carry his Majesty, from time to time, game of his master's taking. One day in particular, when he knew for certain that the King was to take the air, along the river side, with his daughter, the most beautiful Princess in the world, he said to his master:\n\n\"If you will follow my advice, your fortune is made; you have nothing else to do, but go and wash yourself in the river, in that part I shall shew you, and leave the rest to me.\"\n\nThe Marquis of Carabas did what the Cat advised him to, without knowing why or wherefore.\n\nWhile he was washing, the King passed by, and the Cat began to cry out, as loud as he could:\n\n\"Help, help, my lord Marquis of Carabas is drowning.\"\n\nAt this noise the King put his head out of his coach-window, and finding it was the Cat who had so often brought him such good game, he commanded his guards to run immediately to the assistance of his lordship the Marquis of Carabas.\n\nWhile they were drawing the poor Marquis out of the river, the Cat came up to the coach, and told the King that while his master was washing, there came by some rogues, who went off with his clothes, tho' he had cried out \"Thieves, thieves,\" several times, as loud as he could. This cunning[72] Cat had hidden them under a great stone. The King immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one of his best suits for the lord Marquis of Carabas.\n\nThe King received him with great kindness, and as the fine clothes he had given him extremely set off his good mien (for he was well made, and very handsome in his person), the King's daughter took a secret inclination to him, and the Marquis of Carabas had no sooner cast two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances, but she fell in love with him to distraction. The King would needs have him come into his coach, and take part of the airing. The Cat, quite overjoyed to see his project begin to succeed, marched on before, and meeting with some countrymen, who were mowing a meadow, he said to them:\n\n\"Good people, you who are mowing, if you do not tell the King, that the meadow you mow belongs to my lord Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as mince-meat.\"\n\nThe King did not fail asking of the mowers, to whom the meadow they were mowing belonged.\n\n\"To my lord Marquis of Carabas,\" answered they all together; for the Cat's threats had made them terribly afraid.\n\n\"Truly a fine estate,\" said the King to the Marquis of Carabas.\n\n\"You see, sir,\" said the Marquis, \"this is a meadow which never fails to yield a plentiful harvest every year.\"[73]\n\nThe Master Cat, who still went on before, met with some reapers, and said to them:\n\n\"Good people, you who are reaping, if you do not tell the King that all this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as mince-meat.\"\n\nThe King, who passed by a moment after, would needs know to whom all that corn, which he then saw, did belong. \"To my lord Marquis of Carabas,\" replied the reapers; and the King again congratulated the Marquis.\n\nThe Master Cat, who went always before, said the same words to all he met; and the King was astonished at the vast estates of my lord Marquis of Carabas.\n\nMonsieur Puss came at last to a stately castle, the master of which was an Ogre, the richest had ever been known; for all the lands which the King had then gone over belonged to this castle. The Cat, who had taken care to inform himself who this Ogre was, and what he could do, asked to speak with him, saying, he could not pass so near his castle, without having the honour of paying his respects to him.\n\nThe Ogre received him as civilly as an Ogre could do, and made him sit down.\n\n\"I have been assured,\" said the Cat, \"that you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a mind to; you can, for example, transform yourself into a lion, or elephant, and the like.\"\n\n\"This is true,\" answered the Ogre very briskly, \"and to convince you, you shall see me now become a lion.\"\n\nPuss was so sadly terrified at the sight of a lion so near him, that he immediately got into the gutter, not without abundance of trouble and danger, because of his boots, which were ill-suited for walking upon the tiles. A little while after, when Puss saw that the Ogre had resumed his natural form, he came down, and owned he had been very much frightened.\n\n\"I have been moreover informed,\" said the Cat, \"but I know not how to believe it, that you have also the power to take on you the shape of the smallest animals; for example, to change yourself into a rat or a mouse; but I must own to you, I take this to be impossible.\"\n\n\"Impossible?\" cried the Ogre, \"you shall see that presently,\" and at the same time changed into a mouse, and began to run about the floor.\n\nPuss no sooner perceived this, but he fell upon him, and ate him up.\n\nMeanwhile the King, who saw, as he passed, this fine castle of the Ogre's, had a mind to go into it. Puss, who heard the noise of his Majesty's coach running over the drawbridge, ran out and said to the King:\n\n\"Your Majesty is welcome to this castle of my lord Marquis of Carabas.\"\n\n\"What! my lord Marquis?\" cried the King, \"and does this castle also belong to you? There can be nothing finer than this court, and all the stately buildings which surround it; let us go into it, if you please.\"\n\nThe Marquis gave his hand to the Princess, and followed the King, who went up first. They passed into a spacious hall, where they found a magnificent collation which the Ogre had prepared for his friends, who were that very day to visit him, but dared not to enter knowing the King was there. His Majesty was perfectly charmed with the good qualities of my lord Marquis of Carabas, as was his daughter who was fallen violently in love with him; and seeing the vast estate he possessed, said to him, after having drank five or six glasses:\n\n\"It will be owing to yourself only, my lord Marquis, if you are not my son-in-law.\"\n\nThe Marquis making several low bows, accepted the honour which his Majesty conferred upon him, and forthwith, that very same day, married the Princess.\n\nPuss became a great lord, and never ran after mice any more, but only for his diversion.",

    "content": "In the reign of good Queen Bess, there was an honest, industrious countryman named Meanwell, who, living under a hard landlord, was cruelly turned out of his little farm, which had enabled him to support a wife and two children, called Tommy and Margery. Care and misfortune soon shortened his days; and his wife, not long after, followed him to the grave. At her death the two poor children were left in a sad plight, and had to make all sorts of shifts to keep themselves from starving. They were also without proper clothes to keep them warm; and as for shoes, they had not even two pairs between them: Tommy, who had to go about more than his sister, had a pair to himself, but little Margery for a long time wore but one shoe.\n\nBut Heaven had heard their dying mother's prayers, and had watched over and protected them. Relief was at hand, and better things were in store for them. It happened that Mr. Goodall, the clergyman of the parish, heard of their sad wandering sort of life, and so he sent for the two children, and kindly offered to shelter them until they could get regular work to do. Soon after this, a gentleman came from London on a visit, and no sooner did he hear the story of the orphans, than he resolved to be their friend. The very first thing he did was to order a pair of shoes to be made for Margery. And he offered to take Tommy to London, promising to put him in a way to do well by going abroad.\n\nGoody Two Shoes frontis\n\nAs these two children loved each other very dearly, Margery was in great trouble when the time came for her brother to start, and wept bitterly. But Tommy, in order to comfort her, promised he would not fail to come back to see her, when he should return from foreign countries.\n\nAfter he was gone, Margery began to recover her usual cheerfulness: but what helped greatly to put her into good spirits, was the pleasure she took in her new shoes. As soon as the old shoemaker brought them, she put them on, and ran at once to the clergyman's wife, crying out with glee, as she pointed to them, \"Two shoes, ma'am! See, Two shoes!\" These words she kept on repeating to everybody she met, and so came to be called Goody Two Shoes.\n\nGoody Two Shoes illustration 2\n\nNow Margery was a thoughtful little girl, and was most anxious to learn to read and write. When Mr. Goodall saw this, he kindly taught her what she most wished to know, and in a short time she became a better scholar than any of the children who went to the village school. As soon as she found that this was the case, she thought she would try to teach such poor children as could not go to school. Now, as very few books were then printed, she thought she could get over the difficulty by cutting, out of wood, six sets of capital letters like these:—\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z.\n\nAnd ten sets of these common letters:—\n\na b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z.\n\nGoody Two Shoes illustration alphabet\n\nWhen, after much pains and trouble, she had finished all these wooden letters, she managed to borrow an old spelling-book, and, with the help of this, she made her playmates set up the words she wished them to spell.\n\nOne day, as Margery was coming home from the next village, she met with some wicked, idle boys, who had tied a young raven to a staff, and were just going to throw stones at it. She offered at once to buy the raven for a penny, and this they agreed to. She then brought him home to the parsonage, and gave him the name of Ralph, and a fine bird he was. Madge soon taught him to speak several words, and also to pick up letters, and even to spell a word or two.\n\nSome years before Margery began to teach the poor cottagers' children, Sir Walter Welldon, a wealthy knight, had set up an elderly widow lady in a small school in the village. This gentlewoman was at length taken ill, and was no longer able to attend to her duties. When Sir Walter heard of this, he sent for Mr. Goodall, and asked him to look out for some one who would be able and willing to take Mrs. Gray's place as mistress of the school.\n\nThe worthy clergyman could think of no one so well qualified for the task as Margery Meanwell, who, though but young, was grave beyond her years, and was growing up to be a comely maiden; and when he told his mind to the knight, Margery was at once chosen. Sir Walter built a larger school-house for Margery's use; so that she could have all her old pupils about her that liked to come, as well as the regular scholars.\n\nFrom this time, no one called her \"Goody Two Shoes,\" but generally Mrs. Margery, and she was more and more liked and respected by her neighbours.\n\nSoon after Margery had become mistress of the school, she saved a dove from some cruel boys, and she called him Tom, in remembrance of her brother now far away, and from whom she had heard no tidings.\n\nGoody Two Shoes illustration 3\n\nAbout this time a lamb had lost its dam, and its owner was about to have it killed; when Margery heard of this, she bought the lamb and brought it home. Some neighbours, finding how fond of such pets Margery was, presented her with a nice playful little dog called Jumper, and also with a skylark. Now, master Ralph was a shrewd bird, and a bit of a wag too, and when Will, the lamb, and Carol, the lark, made their appearance, the knowing fellow picked out the following verse, to the great amusement of everybody:—\n\n\"Early to bed, and early to rise,\nIs the way to be healthy, wealthy, and wise.\"\nMrs. Margery was ever on the look-out to be useful to her neighbours. Now a traveller from London had presented her with a new kind of instrument, a rough-looking barometer, by the help of which she could often guess correctly how the weather would be, a day or two beforehand. This caused a great talk about the country, and so provoked were the people of the distant villages at the better luck of the Mouldwell folks, that they accused Mrs. Margery of being a witch, and sent old Nicky Noodle to go and tax her with it, and to scrape together whatever evidence he could against her. When this wiseacre saw her at her school-door, with her raven on one shoulder and the dove on the other, the lark on her hand, and the lamb and little dog by her side, the sight took his breath away for a time, and he scampered off, crying out, \"A witch, a witch, a witch!\"\n\nShe laughed at the simpleton's folly, and called him jocosely a \"conjuror!\" for his pains; but poor Mrs. Margery did not know how much folly and wickedness there was in the world, and she was greatly surprised to find that the half-witted Nicky Noodle had got a warrant against her.\n\nAt the meeting of the justices, before whom she was summoned to appear, many of her neighbours were present, ready to speak up for her character if needful. But it turned out that the charge made against her was nothing more than Nicky's idle tale that she was a witch. Now-a-days it seems strange that such a thing could be; but in England, at that period, so fondly styled by some \"the good old times,\" many silly and wicked things were constantly being done, especially by the rich and powerful against the poor—such things as would not now be borne.\n\nIt happened that, among the justices who met to hear this charge against Mrs. Margery, there was but one silly enough to think there was any ground for it; his name was Shallow, and it was he who had granted the warrant. But she soon silenced him when he kept repeating that she must be a witch to foretell the weather, besides harbouring many strange creatures about her, by explaining the use of her weather-glass.\n\nGoody Two Shoes illustration 4\n\nFortunately her patron, Sir Walter Welldon, was well acquainted with the use of the new instrument. When he had explained its nature to his foolish brother-justice, he turned the whole charge into ridicule, and gave Mrs. Margery such a high character, that the justices not only released her at once, but gave her their public thanks for the good services she had done in their neighbourhood.\n\nOne of these gentlemen, Sir Edward Lovell, who was a widower, fell ill, and requested Mrs. Margery to take charge of his house, and look after his dear children. Having taken counsel with her kind old friend the clergyman, she consented to this, and quite won Sir Edward's respect and admiration by her skill and tenderness in nursing him, and by the great care she took of his children.\n\nBy the time that Sir Edward fully regained his health, he had become more and more attached to Mrs. Margery. It was not then to be wondered at, that when she talked of going back to her school, he should offer her his hand in marriage. This proposal took her quite by surprise, but she really loved Sir Edward; and her friends, Sir Walter and Mr. Goodall, advised her to accept him, telling her she would then be able to do many more good works than she had ever done before.\n\nGoody Two Shoes illustration 5\n\nAll things having been settled, and the day fixed, the great folks and others in the neighbourhood came in crowds to see the wedding, for glad they were that one who had, ever since she was a child, been so deserving, was to be thus rewarded. Just as the bride and bridegroom were about to enter the church, their friends assembled outside were busily engaged in watching the progress of a horseman, handsomely dressed and mounted, who was galloping up a distant slope leading to the church, as eagerly as if he wanted to get there before the marriage. This gentleman, so elegantly dressed, proved to be no other than Margaret's brother, our former acquaintance little Tommy, just returned with great honour and profit from a distant foreign country. When they had recovered from this pleasant surprise, the loving couple returned to the altar, and were married, to the satisfaction of all present.\n\nAfter her happy marriage, Lady Lovell continued to practise all kinds of good; and took great pains in increasing and improving the school of which she had been the mistress, and placed there a poor but worthy scholar and his wife to preside over it.",

    "content": "Old Mother Goose lived in a cottage with her son Jack. Jack was a very good lad, and although he was not handsome, he was good-tempered and industrious, and this made him better-looking than half the other boys. Old Mother Goose carried a long stick, she wore a high-crowned hat, and high-heeled shoes, and her kerchief was as white as snow. Then there was the Gander that swam in the pond, and the Owl that sat on the wall. So you see they formed a very happy family. But what a fine strong fellow the Gander was! Whenever Old Mother Goose wanted to take a journey, she would mount upon his broad strong back, and away he would fly and carry her swiftly to any distance.\n\nOld Mother Goose and Her Son Jack\n\nNow Old Mother Goose thought her Gander often looked sad and lonely; so one day she sent Jack to market to buy the finest Goose he could find. It was early in the morning when he started, and his way lay through a wood. He was not afraid of robbers; so on he went, with his Mother's great clothes-prop over his shoulder. The fresh morning air caused Jack's spirits to rise. He left the road, and plunged into the thick of the wood, where he amused himself by leaping with his clothes-prop till he found he had lost himself. After he had made many attempts to find the path again, he heard a scream. He jumped up and ran boldly towards the spot from which the sound came. Through an opening in the trees he saw a young lady trying to get away from a ruffian who wanted to steal her mantle. With one heavy blow of his staff Jack sent the thief howling away, and then went back to the young lady, who was lying on the ground, crying.\n\nOld Mother Goose and Her Son Jack rescues girl\n\nShe soon dried her tears when she found that the robber had made off, and thanked Jack for his help. The young lady told Jack that she was the daughter of the Squire, who lived in the great white house on the hill-top. She knew the path out of the wood quite well, and when they reached the border, she said that Jack must come soon to her father's house, so that he might thank him for his noble conduct.\n\nWhen Jack was left alone, he made the best of his way to the market-place. He found little trouble in picking out the best Goose, for when he got there he was very late, and there was but one left. But as it was a prime one, Jack bought it at once, and keeping to the road, made straight for home. At first the Goose objected to be carried; and then, when she had walked along slowly and gravely for a short time, she tried to fly away; so Jack seized her in his arms and kept her there till he reached home.\n\nOld Mother Goose and Her Son Jack with goose\n\nOld Mother Goose was greatly pleased when she saw what a fine bird Jack had bought; and the Gander showed more joy than I can describe. And then they all lived very happily for a long time. But Jack would often leave off work to dream of the lovely young lady whom he had rescued in the forest, and soon began to sigh all day long. He neglected the garden, cared no more for the Gander, and scarcely even noticed the beautiful Goose. But one morning, as he was walking by the pond, he saw both the Goose and the Gander making a great noise, as though they were in the utmost glee. He went up to them and was surprised to find on the bank a large golden egg. He ran with it to his mother, who said, “Go to market, my son; sell your egg, and you will soon be rich enough to pay a visit to the Squire.” So to market Jack went, and sold his golden egg; but the rogue who bought it of him cheated him out of half his due. Then he dressed himself in his finest clothes, and went up to the Squire's house. Two footmen stood at the door, one looking very stout and saucy, and the other sleepy and stupid.\n\nOld Mother Goose and Her Son Jack and footmen\n\nWhen Jack asked to see the Squire, they laughed at him, and made sport of his fine clothes; but Jack had wit enough to offer them each a guinea, when they at once showed him to the Squire's room.\n\nNow the Squire, who was very rich, was also very proud and fat, and scarcely turned his head to notice Jack; but when he showed him his bag of gold, and asked for his daughter to be his bride, the Squire flew into a rage, and ordered his servants to throw him into the horse-pond. But this was not so easy to do, for Jack was strong and active; and then the young lady come out and begged her father to release him. This made Jack more deeply in love with her than ever, and he went home determined to win her in spite of all. And well did his wonderful Goose aid him in his design. Almost every morning she would lay him a golden egg, and Jack, grown wiser, would no longer sell them at half their value to the rogue who had before cheated him. So Jack soon grew to be a richer man than the Squire himself. His wealth became known to all the country round, and the Squire at length consented to accept Jack as his son-in-law. Then Old Mother Goose flew away into the woods on the back of her strong Gander, leaving the cottage and the Goose to Jack and his bride, who lived happily ever afterwards.",

    "content": "Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to marry a princess; but she would have to be a real princess. He travelled all over the world to find one, but nowhere could he get what he wanted. There were princesses enough, but it was difficult to find out whether they were real ones. There was always something about them that was not as it should be. So he came home again and was sad, for he would have liked very much to have a real princess.\n\nOne evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in torrents. Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open it.\n\nIt was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. But, good gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look. The water ran down from her hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at the heels. And yet she said that she was a real princess.\n\nWell, we'll soon find that out, thought the old queen. But she said nothing, went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses.\n\nOn this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning she was asked how she had slept.\n\nOh, very badly! said she. I have scarcely closed my eyes all night. Heaven only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying on something hard, so that I am black and blue all over my body. It's horrible!\n\nNow they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds.\n\nNobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that.\n\nSo the prince took her for his wife, for now he knew that he had a real princess; and the pea was put in the museum, where it may still be seen, if no one has stolen it.\n\nThere, that is a true story.",

    "content": "There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire. These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, and had the greatest desire to eat some. This desire increased every day, and as she knew that she could not get any of it, she quite pined away, and looked pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and asked, \"What aileth thee, dear wife?\" \"Ah,\" she replied, \"if I can't get some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, to eat, I shall die.\" The man, who loved her, thought, \"Sooner than let thy wife die, bring her some of the rampion thyself, let it cost thee what it will.\" In the twilight of the evening, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it with much relish. She, however, liked it so much—-so very much, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening, therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him. \"How canst thou dare,\" said she with angry look, \"to descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief? Thou shalt suffer for it!\" \"Ah,\" answered he, \"let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat.\" Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him, \"If the case be as thou sayest, I will allow thee to take away with thee as much rampion as thou wilt, only I make one condition, thou must give me the child which thy wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.\" The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.\n\nRapunzel grew into the most beautiful child beneath the sun. When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried,\n\n\"Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nLet down your hair to me.\"\n\nRapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.\n\nAfter a year or two, it came to pass that the King's son rode through the forest and went by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The King's son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried,\n\n\"Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nLet down your hair.\"\n\nThen Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her. \"If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I will for once try my fortune,\" said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried,\n\n\"Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nLet down your hair.\"\n\nImmediately the hair fell down and the King's son climbed up.\n\nAt first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her; but the King's son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought, \"He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does;\" and she said yes, and laid her hand in his. She said, \"I will willingly go away with thee, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with thee a skein of silk every time that thou comest, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and thou wilt take me on thy horse.\" They agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said to her, \"Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young King's son—-he is with me in a moment.\" \"Ah! thou wicked child,\" cried the enchantress \"What do I hear thee say! I thought I had separated thee from all the world, and yet thou hast deceived me.\" In her anger she clutched Rapunzel's beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery.\n\nOn the same day, however, that she cast out Rapunzel, the enchantress in the evening fastened the braids of hair which she had cut off, to the hook of the window, and when the King's son came and cried,\n\n\"Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nLet down your hair,\"\n\nshe let the hair down. The King's son ascended, but he did not find his dearest Rapunzel above, but the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks. \"Aha!\" she cried mockingly, \"Thou wouldst fetch thy dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the cat has got it, and will scratch out thy eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost to thee; thou wilt never see her more.\" The King's son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell, pierced his eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did nothing but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented.",

    "content": "Once on a time there was a Little Old Woman who lived in a Shoe. This shoe stood near a great forest, and was so large that it served as a house for the Old Lady and all her children, of which she had so many that she did not know what to do with them.\n\nBut the Little Old Woman was very fond of her children, and they only thought of the best way to please her. Strong-arm, the eldest, cut down trees for firewood. Peter made baskets of wicker-work. Mark was chief gardener. Lizzie milked the cow, and Jenny taught the younger children to read.\n\nNow this Little Old Woman had not always lived in a Shoe. She and her family had once dwelt in a nice house covered with ivy, and her husband was a wood-cutter, like Strong-arm. But there lived in a huge castle beyond the forest, a fierce giant, who one day came and laid their house in ruins with his club; after which he carried off the poor wood-cutter to his castle beyond the forest. When the Little Old Woman came home, her house was in ruins and her husband was no where to be seen.\n\nThe Little Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe Giant\n\nNight came on, and as the father did not return, the Old Lady and her family went to search for him. When they came to that part of the wood where the Giant had met their father, they saw an immense shoe. They spent a long time weeping and calling out for their father, but met with no reply. Then the Old Lady thought that they had better take shelter in the shoe until they could build a new house. So Peter and Strong-arm put a roof to it, and cut a door, and turned it into a dwelling. Here they all lived happily for many years, but the Little Old Lady never forgot her husband and his sad fate. Strong-arm, who saw how wretched his mother often was about it, proposed to the next eleven brothers that they should go with him and set their father free from the Giant. Their mother knew the Giant's strength, and would not hear of the attempt, as she feared they would be killed. But Strong-arm was not afraid. He bought a dozen sharp swords, and Peter made as many strong shields and helmets, as well as cross-bows and iron-headed arrows. They were now quite ready; Strong-arm gave the order to march, and they started for the forest. The next day they came in sight of the Giant's Castle. Strong-arm, leaving his brothers in a wood close by, strode boldly up to the entrance, and seized the knocker. The door was opened by a funny little boy with a large head, who kept grinning and laughing.\n\nThe Little Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe Strong-arm\n\nStrong-arm then walked boldly across the court-yard, and presently met a page, who took off his hat and asked him what he wanted. Strong-arm said he had come to liberate his father, who was kept a prisoner by the Giant; on this the little man said he was sorry for him, because the part of the castle in which his father was kept was guarded by a large dragon. Strong-arm, nothing daunted, soon found the monster, who was fast asleep, so he made short work of him by sending his sword right through his heart; at which he jumped up, uttering a loud scream, and made as if he would spring forward and seize Strong-arm; but the good sword had done its work, and the monster fell heavily on the ground, dead.\n\nThe Little Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe Dragon\n\nNow the Giant, who had been drinking much wine, was fast asleep in a remote part of the castle. Strong-arm had no sooner finished the Dragon, than up started the funny little boy who had opened the door. He led Strong-arm round to another part of the court-yard, where he saw his poor father, who at once sprung to his feet, and embraced him. Then Strong-arm called up his brothers, and when they had embraced their father, they soon broke his chain and set him free.\n\nWe must now return to the Little Old Woman. After her sons had started she gave way to the most bitter grief. While she was in this state, an old witch came up to her, and said she would help her, as she hated the Giant, and wished to kill him. The Old Witch then took the little Old Lady on her broom, and they sailed off through the air, straight to the Giant's castle.\n\nThe Little Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe Witch\n\nNow this old Witch had great power, and at once afflicted the Giant with corns and tender feet. When he awoke from his sleep he was in such pain that he could bear it no longer, so he thought he would go in search of his missing shoe, which, like the other one he had in his castle, was easy and large for his foot. When he came to the spot where the Old Lady and her children lived, he saw his old shoe, and with a laugh that shook the trees, he thrust his foot into it, breaking through the roof that Strong-arm and Peter had put to it. The children, in great alarm, rushed about inside the shoe, and frightened and trembling, scrambled through the door and the slits which the Giant had formerly made for his corns. By this time the witch and the Little Old Lady, as also Strong-arm, his eleven brother and his father, were come up to the spot. Strong-arm and his brothers shot their arrows at him till at last he fell wounded, when Strong-arm went up to him and cut off his head. Then the father and the Little Old Woman and all their children built a new house, and lived happily ever afterwards.",

    "content": "The Little Pig who Went to Market.\n\nThere was once a family of Five Little Pigs, and Mrs. Pig, their mother, loved them all very dearly. Some of these little pigs were very good, and took a great deal of trouble to please her. The eldest pig was so active and useful that he was called Mr. Pig. One day he went to market with his cart full of vegetables, but Rusty, the donkey, began to show his bad temper before he had gone very far on the road. All the coaxing and whipping would not make him move. So Mr. Pig took him out of the shafts, and being very strong, drew the cart to market himself. When he got there, all the other pigs began to laugh. But they did not laugh so loudly when Mr. Pig told them all his struggles on the road. Mr. Pig lost no time in selling his vegetables, and very soon after Rusty came trotting into the market-place, and as he now seemed willing to take his place in the cart, Mr. Pig started for home without delay. When he got there, he told Mrs. Pig his story, and she called him her best and most worthy son.\n\nThe History of Five Little Pigs Mr. Pig\n\nThe Little Pig who Stayed at Home.\n\nThis little pig very much wanted to go with his brother, but as he was so mischievous that he could not be trusted far away, his mother made him stay at home, and told him to keep a good fire while she went out to the miller's to buy some flour. But as soon as he was alone, instead of learning his lessons, he began to tease the poor cat. Then he got the bellows, and cut the leather with a knife, so as to see where the wind came from: and when he could not find this out, he began to cry. After this he broke all his brother's toys; he forced the drum-stick through the drum, he tore off the tail from the kite, and then pulled off the horse's head. And then he went to the cupboard and ate the jam. When Mrs. Pig came home, she sat down by the fire, and being very tired, she soon fell asleep. No sooner had she done so, than this bad little pig got a long handkerchief and tied her in her chair. But soon she awoke and found out all the mischief that he had been doing. She saw at once the damage that he had done to his brother's playthings. So she quickly brought out her thickest and heaviest birch, and gave this naughty little pig such a beating as he did not forget for a long time.\n\nThe History of Five Little Pigs Stayed Home\n\nThe Little Pig who had Roast Beef.\n\nThis little pig was a very good and careful fellow. He gave his mother scarcely any trouble, and always took a pleasure in doing all she bade him. Here you see him sitting down with clean hands and face, to some nice roast beef, while his brother, the idle pig, who is standing on a stool in the corner, with the dunce's cap on, has none. He sat down and quietly learned his lesson, and asked his mother to hear him repeat it. And this he did so well that Mrs. Pig stroked him on the ears and forehead, and called him a good little pig. After this he asked her to allow him to help her make tea. He brought everything she wanted, and lifted off the kettle from the fire, without spilling a drop either on his toes or the carpet. By-and-bye he went out, after asking his mother's leave, to play with his hoop. He had not gone far when he saw an old blind pig, who, with his hat in his hand was crying at the loss of his dog; so he put his hand in his pocket and found a halfpenny which he gave to the poor old pig. It was for such thoughtful conduct as this that his mother often gave this little pig roast beef. We now come to the little pig who had none.\nThe History of Five Little Pigs Roast Beef\n\nThe Little Pig who had None.\n\nThis was a most obstinate and willful little pig. His mother had set him to learn his lesson, but no sooner had she gone out into the garden, than he tore his book into pieces. When his mother came back he ran off into the streets to play with other idle little pigs like himself. After this he quarrelled with one of the pigs and got a sound thrashing. Being afraid to go home, he stayed out till it was quite dark and caught a severe cold. So he was taken home and put to bed, and had to take a lot of nasty physic.\n\nThe History of Five Little Pigs Had None\n\nThe Little Pig who Cried “Wee, wee,” all the Way Home.\n\nThis little pig went fishing. Now he had been told not to go into Farmer Grumpey's grounds, who did not allow any one to fish in his part of the river. But in spite of what he had been told, this foolish little pig went there. He soon caught a very large fish, and while he was trying to carry it home, Farmer Grumpey came running along with his great whip. He quickly dropped the fish, but the farmer caught him, and as he laid his whip over his back for some time, the little pig ran off, crying, “Wee, wee, wee,” all the way home.",

    "content": "Many years ago, there was an Emperor, who was so excessively fond of new clothes, that he spent all his money in dress. He did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers; nor did he care to go either to the theatre or the chase, except for the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new clothes. He had a different suit for each hour of the day; and as of any other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say, \"he is sitting in council,\" it was always said of him, \"The Emperor is sitting in his wardrobe.\"\n\nTime passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; strangers arrived every day at the court. One day, two rogues, calling themselves weavers, made their appearance. They gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held, or who was extraordinarily simple in character.\n\n\"These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!\" thought the Emperor. \"Had I such a suit, I might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit for their office, and also be able to distinguish the wise from the foolish! This stuff must be woven for me immediately.\" And he caused large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly.\n\nSo the two pretended weavers set up two looms, and affected to work very busily, though in reality they did nothing at all. They asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold thread; put both into their own knapsacks; and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms until late at night.\n\n\"I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth,\" said the Emperor to himself, after some little time had elapsed; he was, however, rather embarrassed, when he remembered that a simpleton, or one unfit for his office, would be unable to see the manufacture. To be sure, he thought he had nothing to risk in his own person; but yet, he would prefer sending somebody else, to bring him intelligence about the weavers, and their work, before he troubled himself in the affair. All the people throughout the city had heard of the wonderful property the cloth was to possess; and all were anxious to learn how wise, or how ignorant, their neighbors might prove to be.\n\n\"I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers,\" said the Emperor at last, after some deliberation, \"he will be best able to see how the cloth looks; for he is a man of sense, and no one can be more suitable for his office than he is.\"\n\nSo the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were working with all their might, at their empty looms. \"What can be the meaning of this?\" thought the old man, opening his eyes very wide. \"I cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms.\" However, he did not express his thoughts aloud.\n\nThe impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms; and then asked him whether the design pleased him, and whether the colors were not very beautiful; at the same time pointing to the empty frames. The poor old minister looked and looked, he could not discover anything on the looms, for a very good reason, viz: there was nothing there. \"What!\" thought he again. \"Is it possible that I am a simpleton? I have never thought so myself; and no one must know it now if I am so. Can it be, that I am unfit for my office? No, that must not be said either. I will never confess that I could not see the stuff.\"\n\n\"Well, Sir Minister!\" said one of the knaves, still pretending to work. \"You do not say whether the stuff pleases you.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is excellent!\" replied the old minister, looking at the loom through his spectacles. \"This pattern, and the colors, yes, I will tell the Emperor without delay, how very beautiful I think them.\"\n\n\"We shall be much obliged to you,\" said the impostors, and then they named the different colors and described the pattern of the pretended stuff. The old minister listened attentively to their words, in order that he might repeat them to the Emperor; and then the knaves asked for more silk and gold, saying that it was necessary to complete what they had begun. However, they put all that was given them into their knapsacks; and continued to work with as much apparent diligence as before at their empty looms.\n\nThe Emperor now sent another officer of his court to see how the men were getting on, and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready. It was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister; he surveyed the looms on all sides, but could see nothing at all but the empty frames.\n\n\"Does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you, as it did to my lord the minister?\" asked the impostors of the Emperor's second ambassador; at the same time making the same gestures as before, and talking of the design and colors which were not there.\n\n\"I certainly am not stupid!\" thought the messenger. \"It must be, that I am not fit for my good, profitable office! That is very odd; however, no one shall know anything about it.\" And accordingly he praised the stuff he could not see, and declared that he was delighted with both colors and patterns. \"Indeed, please your Imperial Majesty,\" said he to his sovereign when he returned, \"the cloth which the weavers are preparing is extraordinarily magnificent.\"\n\nThe whole city was talking of the splendid cloth which the Emperor had ordered to be woven at his own expense.\n\nAnd now the Emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture, while it was still in the loom. Accompanied by a select number of officers of the court, among whom were the two honest men who had already admired the cloth, he went to the crafty impostors, who, as soon as they were aware of the Emperor's approach, went on working more diligently than ever; although they still did not pass a single thread through the looms.\n\n\"Is not the work absolutely magnificent?\" said the two officers of the crown, already mentioned. \"If your Majesty will only be pleased to look at it! What a splendid design! What glorious colors!\" and at the same time they pointed to the empty frames; for they imagined that everyone else could see this exquisite piece of workmanship.\n\n\"How is this?\" said the Emperor to himself. \"I can see nothing! This is indeed a terrible affair! Am I a simpleton, or am I unfit to be an Emperor? That would be the worst thing that could happen--Oh! the cloth is charming,\" said he, aloud. \"It has my complete approbation.\" And he smiled most graciously, and looked closely at the empty looms; for on no account would he say that he could not see what two of the officers of his court had praised so much. All his retinue now strained their eyes, hoping to discover something on the looms, but they could see no more than the others; nevertheless, they all exclaimed, \"Oh, how beautiful!\" and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material, for the approaching procession. \"Magnificent! Charming! Excellent!\" resounded on all sides; and everyone was uncommonly gay. The Emperor shared in the general satisfaction; and presented the impostors with the riband of an order of knighthood, to be worn in their button-holes, and the title of \"Gentlemen Weavers.\"\n\nThe rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take place, and had sixteen lights burning, so that everyone might see how anxious they were to finish the Emperor's new suit. They pretended to roll the cloth off the looms; cut the air with their scissors; and sewed with needles without any thread in them. \"See!\" cried they, at last. \"The Emperor's new clothes are ready!\"\n\nAnd now the Emperor, with all the grandees of his court, came to the weavers; and the rogues raised their arms, as if in the act of holding something up, saying, \"Here are your Majesty's trousers! Here is the scarf! Here is the mantle! The whole suit is as light as a cobweb; one might fancy one has nothing at all on, when dressed in it; that, however, is the great virtue of this delicate cloth.\"\n\n\"Yes indeed!\" said all the courtiers, although not one of them could see anything of this exquisite manufacture.\n\n\"If your Imperial Majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your clothes, we will fit on the new suit, in front of the looking glass.\"\n\nThe Emperor was accordingly undressed, and the rogues pretended to array him in his new suit; the Emperor turning round, from side to side, before the looking glass.\n\n\"How splendid his Majesty looks in his new clothes, and how well they fit!\" everyone cried out. \"What a design! What colors! These are indeed royal robes!\"\n\n\"The canopy which is to be borne over your Majesty, in the procession, is waiting,\" announced the chief master of the ceremonies.\n\n\"I am quite ready,\" answered the Emperor. \"Do my new clothes fit well?\" asked he, turning himself round again before the looking glass, in order that he might appear to be examining his handsome suit.\n\nThe lords of the bedchamber, who were to carry his Majesty's train felt about on the ground, as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle; and pretended to be carrying something; for they would by no means betray anything like simplicity, or unfitness for their office.\n\nSo now the Emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the procession, through the streets of his capital; and all the people standing by, and those at the windows, cried out, \"Oh! How beautiful are our Emperor's new clothes! What a magnificent train there is to the mantle; and how gracefully the scarf hangs!\" in short, no one would allow that he could not see these much-admired clothes; because, in doing so, he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit for his office. Certainly, none of the Emperor's various suits, had ever made so great an impression, as these invisible ones.\n\n\"But the Emperor has nothing at all on!\" said a little child.\n\n\"Listen to the voice of innocence!\" exclaimed his father; and what the child had said was whispered from one to another.\n\n\"But he has nothing at all on!\" at last cried out all the people. The Emperor was vexed, for he knew that the people were right; but he thought the procession must go on now! And the lords of the bedchamber took greater pains than ever, to appear holding up a train, although, in reality, there was no train to hold.",

Jack was very sad and went to sleep without dinner.\n\nThe next day, when Jack woke up in the morning and looked out of the window, he saw that a huge beanstalk had grown from his magic beans! He climbed up the beanstalk and reached a kingdom in the sky. There lived a giant and his wife. Jack went inside the house and found the giant’s wife in the kitchen. Jack said, “Could you please give me something to eat? I am so hungry!” The kind wife gave him bread and some milk.\n\nWhile he was eating, the giant came home. The giant was very big and looked very fearsome. Jack was terrified and went and hid inside. The giant cried, “Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” The wife said, “There is no boy in here!” So, the giant ate his food and then went to his room. He took out his sacks of gold coins, counted them and kept them aside. Then he went to sleep. In the night, Jack crept out of his hiding place, took one sack of gold coins and climbed down the beanstalk. At home, he gave the coins to his mother. His mother was very happy and they lived well for sometime.\n\nJack and the Beanstalk Fee Fi Fo Fum!Climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant’s house again. Once again, Jack asked the giant’s wife for food, but while he was eating the giant returned. Jack leapt up in fright and went and hid under the bed. The giant cried, “Fee-fifo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” The wife said, “There is no boy in here!” The giant ate his food and went to his room. There, he took out a hen. He shouted, “Lay!” and the hen laid a golden egg. When the giant fell asleep, Jack took the hen and climbed down the beanstalk. Jack’s mother was very happy with him.\n\nAfter some days, Jack once again climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant’s castle. For the third time, Jack met the giant’s wife and asked for some food. Once again, the giant’s wife gave him bread and milk. But while Jack was eating, the giant came home. “Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” cried the giant. “Don’t be silly! There is no boy in here!” said his wife.\n\nThe giant had a magical harp that could play beautiful songs. While the giant slept, Jack took the harp and was about to leave. Suddenly, the magic harp cried, “Help master! A boy is stealing me!” The giant woke up and saw Jack with the harp. Furious, he ran after Jack. But Jack was too fast for him. He ran down the beanstalk and reached home. The giant followed him down. Jack quickly ran inside his house and fetched an axe. He began to chop the beanstalk. The giant fell and died.\n\nJack and his mother were now very rich and they lived happily ever after.",

    "content": "Once upon a time there were two girls who lived with their mother and father. Their father had no work, and the girls wanted to go away and seek their fortunes. Now one girl wanted to go to service, and her mother said she might if she could find a place. So she started for the town. Well, she went all about the town, but no one wanted a girl like her. So she went on farther into the country, and she came to the place where there was an oven where there was lots of bread baking. And the bread said, 'Little girl, little girl, take us out, take us out. We have been baking seven years, and no one has come to take us out.' So the girl took out the bread, laid it on the ground and went on her way. Then she met a cow, and the cow said, 'Little girl, little girl, milk me, milk me! Seven years have I been waiting, and no one has come to milk me.' The girl milked the cow into the pails that stood by. As she was thirsty she drank some, and left the rest in the pails by the cow. Then she went on a little farther, and came to an apple-tree, so loaded with fruit that its branches were breaking down, and the tree said, 'Little girl, little girl, help me shake my fruit. My branches are breaking, it is so heavy.' And the girl said, 'Of course I will, you poor tree.' So she shook the fruit all off, propped up the branches, and left the fruit on the ground under the tree. Then she went on again till she came to a house. Now in this house there lived a witch, and this witch took girls into her house as servants. And when she heard that this girl had left her home to seek service, she said that she would try her, and give her good wages. The witch told the girl what work she was to do. 'You must keep the house clean and tidy, sweep the floor and the fireplace; but there is one thing you must never do. You must never look up the chimney, or something bad will befall you.'\n\nSo the girl promised to do as she was told, but one morning as she was cleaning, and the witch was out, she forgot what the witch said, and looked up the chimney. When she did this a great bag of money fell down in her lap. This happened again and again. So the girl started to go off home.\n\nWhen she had gone some way she heard the witch coming after her. So she ran to the apple-tree and cried:\n\nApple-tree, apple-tree, hide me,\nSo the old witch can't find me;\nIf she does she'll pick my bones,\nAnd bury me under the marble stones.\nSo the apple-tree hid her. When the witch came up she said:\n\nTree of mine, tree of mine,\nHave you seen a girl\nWith a willy-willy wag, and a long-tailed bag,\nWho's stole my money, all I had?\nAnd the apple-tree said, 'No, mother; not for seven year.'\n\nWhen the witch had gone down another way, the girl went on again, and just as she got to the cow heard the witch coming after her again, so she ran to the cow and cried:\n\nCow, cow, hide me,\nSo the old witch can't find me;\nIf she does she'll pick my bones,\nAnd bury me under the marble stones.\nSo the cow hid her.\n\nWhen the old witch came up, she looked about and said to the cow:\n\nCow of mine, cow of mine,\nHave you seen a girl\nWith a willy-willy wag, and a long-tailed bag,\nWho's stole my money, all I had?\nAnd the cow said, 'No, mother, not for seven year.'\n\nWhen the witch had gone off another way, the little girl went on again, and when she was near the oven she heard the witch coming after her again, so she ran to the oven and cried:\n\nOven, oven, hide me,\nSo the old witch can't find me;\nIf she does she'll pick my bones,\nAnd bury me under the marble stones.\nAnd the oven said, 'I've no room, ask the baker,' and the baker hid her behind the oven.\n\nWhen the witch came up she looked here and there and everywhere, and then said to the baker:\n\nMan of mine, man of mine,\nHave you seen a girl,\nWith a willy-willy wag, and a long-tailed bag,\nWho's stole my money, all I had?\nSo the baker said, 'Look in the oven.' The old witch went to look, and the oven said, 'Get in and look in the furthest corner.' The witch did so, and when she was inside the oven shut her door, and the witch was kept there for a very long time.\n\nThe girl then went off again, and reached her home with her money bags, married a rich man, and lived happy ever afterwards.\n\nThe other sister then thought she would go and do the same. And she went the same way. But when she reached the oven, and the bread said, 'Little girl, little girl, take us out. Seven years have we been baking, and no one has come to take us out', the girl said, 'No, I don't want to burn my fingers.' So she went on till she met the cow, and the cow said, 'Little girl, little girl, milk me, milk me, do. Seven years have I been waiting, and no one has come to milk me.' But the girl said, 'No, I can't milk you, I'm in a hurry,' and went on faster. Then she came to the apple-tree, and the apple-tree asked her to help shake the fruit. 'No, I can't; another day p'raps I may,' and went on till she came to the witch's house. Well, it happened to her just the same as to the other girl -- she forgot what she was told, and, one day when the witch was out, looked up the chimney, and down fell a bag of money. Well, she thought she would be off at once. When she reached the apple-tree, she heard the witch coming after her, and she cried:\n\nApple-tree, apple-tree, hide me,\nSo the old witch can't find me;\nIf she does she'll pick my bones,\nAnd bury me under the marble stones.\nBut the tree didn't answer, and she ran on further. Presently the witch came up and said:\n\nTree of mine, tree of mine,\nHave you seen a girl,\nWith a willy-willy wag, and a long-tailed bag,\nWho's stole my money, all I had?'\nThe tree said, 'Yes, mother; she's gone down that way.'\n\nSo the old witch went after her and caught her; she took all the money away from her, beat her, and sent her off home just as she was.",

    "content": "Babette and Antone were the children of a very poor woodcutter. They lived in a little cottage on the side of a steep mountain, and the mountain looked upon a great forest. Now though their father toiled in this forest from dawn until dark, he could earn but little. Wood in that region was plentiful, and woodcutters were numerous. Their mother made fine laces which Antone carried to the market to sell; but in spite of all their efforts, the poor parents seldom could give their children more than bread and broth to eat. Often indeed the broth was lacking if the woodcutter found no hare in the traps he set. Babette and Antone, however, were happy little children and never thought of their poverty. But it worried the woodcutter that Antone was ten years old and had not yet gone to school. Antone's mother taught him to read and write, that the other boys and girls would not be too far beyond him, and Antone studied his lessons diligently. Often as he sat doing his sums on the hearthstone, with a bit of charcoal for a pencil, his mother would sigh sadly. Antone did not like his mother to be sad, and so he always laughed to cheer her.\n\n\"Never fear, Mother,\" he would say. \"Soon I shall send myself to school. My vegetable patch does finely. Then, when I am a great scholar, you shall be poor no longer. My father shall have a team of oxen and you a fine satin gown; Babette shall have a dozen real dollies instead of the turnip dollies she now rocks in her dolly cradle.\"\n\n\"Ah, Antone, my son,\" his mother would answer with a sigh, \"unless you make your fortune as a maker of toys, I fear you will have no fortune at all. Your fingers are as clever as a wizard's even now; and though you are past ten, we cannot spare you to go to school.\"\n\nA Tale for Halloween, Girl with dollIt was true, as she said. Antone made boats from bits of cedar wood, and when he had fitted them with sails you could not tell them from any that had come out of a shop. He carved a doll's cradle from a pine knot, and for a dolly painted the white face of a turnip until one would think it was the face of some fair maiden,—so blue were this turnip dolly's eyes and so pink her cheeks, her hair of golden corn silk fell in such waves and her robe of young cabbage leaves was so green and beautiful. Then as often as this turnip dolly faded and began to shrivel, Antone made another, which Babette declared was always more beautiful than the one before. Babette had never been to the village and therefore knew nothing of real dollies. She loved her turnip babies tenderly indeed; she always carried them in her arm when she went with Antone to meet their father and sang them little songs as she rocked them to sleep.\n\nNow it happened one night in the season of Halloween that Antone sat carving jack-o'-lanterns to sell in the village. Babette, who was rocking her dolly to sleep, sat watching him. Being but six, she knew nothing about the fun which comes with Halloween, and so she listened round-eyed with wonder to Antone, who knew all things about jack-o'-lanterns. When she heard that boys and girls dressed like goblins and witches frolicked in the village streets, Babette made up her mind to frolic too.\n\n\"How fine it must be!\" she cried, clapping her hands. \"Halloween must be quite like Christmas!\"\n\n\"Not quite so fine as Christmas, Babette,\" answered Antone, as he carved the teeth in the last jack-o'-lantern, \"but Halloween is very fine nevertheless. It is comical to see the jack-o'-lanterns bobbing up and down with their faces grinning in the candle light. And on Halloween the boys and girls play pranks on their elders that they would be well switched for at any other time; but every one laughs and is gay on that night.\" Antone finished the jack-o'-lantern and piled it with a dozen more in his little cart. He would sell them all in the village when he took his vegetables to market the next day; no one else could carve such splendid pumpkin faces as Antone.\n\nA Tale for Halloween, carved pumpkin\"Then let us go and play pranks in the village too, Antone,\" cried Babette. \"Mother will make us goblin dresses, and there is still one great pumpkin in your garden for a jack-o'-lantern. Oh, what a frolic we shall have!\"\n\n\"Babette!\" exclaimed Antone in astonishment. \"Wherever did you get such a notion? The frolic in the village is not for us. Mother has no time to make us goblin dresses, and if she did, she has no goods; besides, how should we find our way home through the forest?\"\n\n\"You know the way through the forest, Antone,\" insisted Babette, \"and if Mother cannot make us goblin dresses, we can go without. It will be dark and our jack-o'-lantern will be as fine as any. Do come,\" she begged, \"I have never been to a Halloween frolic.\"\n\n\"Now, Babette, I tell you we cannot go to the village to-morrow night,\" answered Antone. \"I could not find my way home through the forest after dark, and we would both be lost. Be a good girl and do not tease any more.\"\n\nAntone spoke sternly, and Babette burst into tears. She was very fond of her own way, and when she could not have it, sometimes she was a very naughty little girl. She sobbed and wept so piteously that Antone found it hard to refuse her. However, he dared not go to the village at night, as he feared to lose his way in the forest. So Antone trotted Babette on his knee and whispered that he would buy her chocolate; but she only wept the harder.\n\n\"Now, Babette!\" cried Antone at last, when Babette showed no signs of stopping, \"I cannot take you to the village; but if you are a good girl and stop crying at once, I will make a little Halloween frolic just for you and me. Now promise me you will not cry any more.\"\n\nBabette dried her eyes and promised. She wished a Halloween frolic, but whether she frolicked at home or in the village mattered not at all.\n\n\"Will we wear goblin dresses or ghost dresses, Antone?\" she asked.\n\nAntone puzzled a moment before he answered. \"Oh, ghost dresses, I think,\" said he.\n\nA Tale for Halloween, lit jack-o'-lanternThe next day Babette was very good. She helped Antone gather his vegetables for market, and when he returned sat beside him quietly while he carved the last pumpkin from his garden. When the jack-o'-lantern was finished, Antone lighted the candle just for one second so that she might see it grinning in the light. Babette clapped her hands; but he held up a warning finger. The Halloween frolic was to be a secret. After supper the children went to bed as usual, but instead of undressing, they pulled their white nightdresses over their heavy coats.\n\n\"They will do for ghost dresses,\" whispered Antone when all was still, and they crept softly out. In the moonlight the jack-o'-lantern was grinning broadly to greet them.\n\n\"Pumpkin is smiling at us,\" laughed Babette. She was very happy, for her frolic was about to begin.\n\nAntone struck a match to light the candle, but there was no candle in the jack-o'-lantern.\n\n\"I put the candle in; I know I did,\" said he in surprise. He searched in the dark, and Babette stopped her laughing. Antone looked about, and there beneath the bench lay the remainder of his precious candle. It was chewed to bits, and the wick was in shreds.\n\n\"Oh, Babette!\" cried he. \"A wicked rat has stolen our candle, and I paid a whole penny for it too!\"\n\n\"Oh, the bad rats!\" cried Babette, bursting into tears. She stamped her foot and sent the jack-o'-lantern rolling off the bench. It struck the earth with a bump and dented its nose a trifle.\n\n\"Now, Babette, what a baby you are! See what you have done!\" cried Antone. He stooped to pick up the pumpkin, but the pumpkin was too quick for him.\n\n\"Oh, no, you don't,\" laughed Pumpkin in a thick throaty sort of voice. \"Babette smashed my nose a little, but that's no matter on a Halloween night. Good-by, boys and girls,\" he called airily and rolled swiftly down the hill.\n\n\"You come back here; you're my pumpkin,\" cried Antone and started after the runaway. Babette followed, weeping and crying aloud.\n\n\"Oh, my Halloween frolic! Oh, my Halloween frolic!\" she mourned. \"Now we have no jack-o'-lantern and no candle either.\"\n\n\"But just you wait until he rolls down into the vegetable garden,\" shouted Antone, as he chased the swiftly rolling pumpkin. \"He'll have to stop at the hedge.\" He took his little sister's hand that she might run faster. Pumpkin rolled along just in front of them but always just out of their reach. When he reached the hedge, he gave a great leap and landed directly in the vegetable patch.\n\nA Tale for Halloween, dancing vegetables\"Come on, you Turnips! Come on, you Carrots!\" called Pumpkin, as he rolled along. At his words the Carrots and Turnips tore themselves from their beds and followed after him, shouting.\n\n\"Come on! Come on!\" called Pumpkin, and Parsnips and Beets followed the Carrots and Turnips.\n\n\"Look at Antone following us,\" yelled Pumpkin, and all his vegetable followers turned and laughed in derision.\n\n\"Ordinary nights you may be master, Antone,\" cried they, \"but not on Halloween. This is our night.\"\n\n\"Well, you wait until I catch you and then see how hard you'll laugh,\" called Antone angrily. To see his vegetable patch laid waste made him furious.\n\n\"But you'll wait until you catch us before you punish us, won't you, Antone?\" they answered mockingly.\n\n\"Oh, it's Halloween! It's Halloween!\" sang Pumpkin, turning handsprings as he rolled along, and the rest of the vegetables did cartwheels as they went careering after him. They looked like a dozen market stalls upset on the hillside, and poor Antone nearly wept when he thought of his loss. He followed them with determination. Antone was not a lad to give up easily.\n\nA Tale for Halloween, dark forest\"Follow me! Follow me!\" sang Pumpkin, as he led the way to a tiny door that opened beneath the forest. Turnips and Carrots squeezed through, and Antone, fearing to be left behind, caught up Babette and ran faster. Just as he reached the little door, a rough Potato tried to slam it in his face. But Antone was too quick for him. He ran through and climbed down the hole into the underground forest. There he continued the chase, but the ground here was springy and elastic, and with each step Antone began to gain on the vegetables. Babette's fatigue left her, and she shook herself free of Antone's hand.\n\n\"We'll catch up to them,\" declared Antone as they ran along. Even as he spoke, Potato stubbed his toe, and Babette caught him. She held him firmly, although he squirmed and tried his best to get free.\n\n\"Help! Help!\" bawled Potato, when he saw he was a prisoner. \"Oh, Pumpkin, wait for me!\" he cried. The tears streamed from every one of his eyes, and he looked truly sad. At his cries Pumpkin turned around, and all the vegetables followed their leader.\n\n\"Come now, Antone,\" began Pumpkin in a persuasive voice. \"You might let us have one night off, you know. Halloween is our night.\" Somewhere on his run, Pumpkin had picked up two twigs, and on these he now balanced himself rather unsteadily and thrust his leaves in the place where his pockets would have been if he had had pockets. He looked so very jolly and his grin was so very broad that Antone was inclined to give up the prisoner; but just then he thought of the ruined vegetable garden and grew angry again.\n\n\"It is all very well for you to be polite, Pumpkin, and try to beg off your friend,\" said Antone, \"but this is the very fellow that tried to slam the door in my face not two seconds ago.\"\n\n\"Oh, Antone,\" cried Potato, \"that's wrong. It was three seconds ago as true as I live. I looked at my watch just as I was trying to pinch your nose in the underground door, and it's quite three seconds ago; maybe it's four.\"\n\nA Tale for Halloween, carved pumpkin\"Oh, hush up!\" cried Pumpkin. \"That's no way to talk when you are trying to beg off. Let him off for my sake, Antone,\" he continued in a most winning voice. \"You'd get everlastingly tired of being in bed yourself; you know you would. See if you wouldn't take the first chance to kick up your heels if you could get it.\"\n\n\"But, Pumpkin,\" replied Antone, \"think of my vegetable garden; it is ruined. I was saving all my vegetable money to go to school, and now I cannot go for ever and ever so long. Besides, how could I know you got tired of being in a bed? You never spoke to me before.\"\n\n\"Well, I speak to you now,\" replied Pumpkin, \"and as for your vegetable patch, we'll all make that up to you, won't we, boys?\"\n\n\"We will! We will!\" called the vegetables in chorus, and the Potato in Babette's little fist yelled the loudest of all.\n\n\"There, now, you see we mean no harm,\" declared Pumpkin, \"so let Potato go. Then you can both join us in our Halloween frolic.\"\n\nAt the magic words \"Halloween frolic,\" Babette put Potato down at once. She was bound to have her fun, and, after all, the vegetables seemed to be a jolly lot. So peace was made, and the children followed the bobbing Turnips and Onions. Then shouts were heard, and Pumpkin ordered a halt. Presently they were joined by a dozen or more Cabbages.\n\n\"You're nice ones!\" panted the Cabbages. \"There we sat in the storeroom waiting for you to call us, and the first thing we knew we saw you pelting off down the hill like mad things.\"\n\n\"My gracious!\" said a very stout Cabbage, who was terribly out of breath, \"I'll have to take off my outer leaves before I go another step. I feel as though I were boiled.\"\n\nAntone recognized the Cabbages at once. \"You are Father Minette's cabbages, are you not?\" he inquired politely as they marched along.\n\nA Tale for Halloween, dancing vegetables\"Why, if it isn't little Antone, the woodcutter's son!\" exclaimed the very stout Cabbage. \"Yes, we come from Minette's farm. Mother Minette saved us for pickle, but we fooled her and slipped out of the storeroom when she was not looking. Oh, we Cabbages are not so green as we look!\" The Cabbages all laughed, and Antone was surprised to find that he laughed too.\n\nAs they went marching on, Pumpkin sang and danced in the lead, and Onions and Carrots echoed his hearty songs. Presently great black cats with shining yellow eyes stepped from behind the trees, and each cat was soon joined by its mistress, who was no other than a real witch in tall peaked hat and carrying a broomstick. The Cabbages, who were a friendly lot, introduced Antone and Babette to these witches, and the witches seemed pleased to meet the children.\n\n\"They do not seem to be wicked witches, do they, Antone?\" whispered Babette.\n\n\"Oh, my dear,\" replied a witch who overheard, \"we are not a bit wicked on Halloween, you know. Any other night, I would probably do you a mischief. It is my nature, you know.\" She reached in her bag and handed Babette a peppermint. Babette, who was very fond of peppermint, ate it up with all haste.\n\n\"You shouldn't do that, my dear,\" reproved the witch. \"It is seldom witches give peppermints, and when they do the peppermints should be treasured. Here is another to keep for your pocket, and then you will never be without a peppermint when you want one.\" And she handed Babette another. Babette curtseyed so prettily that the witch was charmed and took her to ride on her broomstick.\n\nA Tale for Halloween, the witchesIt was the gayest company one ever could imagine, as they marched along. Every vegetable was singing a different Halloween song in a different key, and they all had voices that sang out of tune by nature. Babette, her little white nightdress flying in the breeze, was riding on the witch's broomstick and singing loudly as the rest. When they reached the dancing-floor it was lighted with millions and millions of glowworms, and an orchestra of ten thousand frogs hummed lively tunes in their throats. Pumpkin seized a handful of glowworms and put them in his head. Then with his features all aglow he cried out:\n\n\"Ready for the dance!\"\n\nInstead of taking partners, the vegetables just plunged on to the floor and began to jump about like mad. If they fell down they did not jump up at once but rolled around the floor most good-naturedly. They looked so like vegetables boiling about in a great soup kettle that Antone thought he should die of laughing. The witches took their brooms and began a sort of \"ladies-change\" figure while they chased their cats around the edge of the circle. Babette danced hardest of all. She knew no more of dancing than any Carrot or Parsnip, but she capered wildly, singing at the top of her voice.\n\n\"Come and dance too, Antone,\" called Babette, as she went jumping past her brother, but he shook his head and laughed.\n\n\"I am too big for such nonsense,\" said he. \"I am ten, you know.\"\n\nA Tale for Halloween, Halloween frolic\"What nonsense!\" cried a witch who was chasing her cat close by. \"Ten is exactly the right age to have fun.\" She raised her broom playfully, and before he knew it, she swept Antone into the middle of the dance. Pumpkin, his grinning features all aglow, went flying past and made Antone feel proud. Pumpkin was certainly the handsomest vegetable of the lot. As the night grew later, the frogs hummed faster, but hum as fast as they would, they could not keep up with the frisky vegetables. Beets and Cauliflowers continued to bob up and down like mad; Cabbages from Minette's farm lost leaf after leaf; Carrots and Onions grew battered from much tumbling about, and the merry din of song and laughter grew louder and louder.\n\n\"Let's play Blind Man's Buff,\" called Antone. \"I'll be 'it' and show you how to play.\" He tied the handkerchief over his eyes, and the witches and their black cats went darting hither and thither. The vegetables were so pleased with this new game that they would play nothing else. They might have been playing it yet had not a cock crowed suddenly.\n\n\"Good gracious me!\" cried a witch. \"The glowworms are all gone out. It's nearly morning. All who are going back to the vegetable patch had best be on their way.\"\n\n\"Not I!\" cried Pumpkin. \"I've done with vegetable patches forevermore.\"\n\n\"Not we,\" exclaimed the Cabbages. \"We're going to turn savage and be wild cabbages for the rest of our days! We shan't go back to Mother Minette's pickle jars.\" Straightway every vegetable began to raise its voice and declare it would not go back to Antone's patch.\n\n\"Oh, hush, all of you!\" cried the witch. \"Stay in the woods for the rest of your life if you like. It is nothing to me; but what of Antone and Babette? Who is to take them home?\"\n\n\"Well, ma'am,\" replied Pumpkin with a low bow, \"we thought that you might be good enough to give them a ride home on your broomstick.\"\n\n\"But Pumpkin!\" cried Antone in dismay, \"you promised to make it up to me if I let Potato go, and I think you should all return with me. I shall not have any vegetables if you all remain in the woods.\"\n\n\"Never worry about that, Antone,\" replied Pumpkin with a lordly air. \"Here is a purse for each of you, and if you take good care never to lose them, you will have plenty of gold forever. Isn't that true, boys?\"\n\n\"True as we're not going back to the farm,\" cried the Cabbages. \"You had best hurry and plant yourself before it grows daylight, Pumpkin,\" they warned and began to dig holes in the earth. Before Antone and Babette had mounted the witch's broomstick, all the Carrots and Turnips and even Pumpkin were all tucked up in their sandy beds. They called a faint good-by as the children sailed off with the witch.\n\n\"Oh, what a beautiful Halloween frolic,\" sighed Babette as she leaned her head on Antone's shoulder and fell fast asleep.\n\nThe broomstick flew with the swiftness of an eagle, and the witch warned Antone to hold Babette with a firm grasp. One by one the stars went out as they sped across the sky. The black cat steered and seemed to know the exact way to the woodcutter's cottage, for just as the dawn was breaking the broomstick glided down to Babette's window. The witch shook hands with Antone, and the black cat politely jumped off to help Antone with his little sister. Before the good creature could mount again, the broomstick was off like whirlwind, and it was left behind.\n\n\"This broomstick is so wild I cannot stop it,\" called the witch from the clouds. \"Keep good care of my cat until next Halloween.\"\n\nAntone put Babette in her little crib and made the black cat a comfortable bed in the kitchen. Then he lay down to sleep and dreamed of the Halloween frolic until he was wakened by his mother.\n\n\"Come, Antone!\" she cried. \"I have good news for you. Only look from the window and see the great black cat without a single white hair that sits washing his face in the sun. Such a cat coming to us on Halloween will surely bring us good luck! But come, my child, get up, for the sun is high, and it is time for you to dig your vegetables for market.\"\n\n\"My vegetables have gone wild in the forest,\" muttered Antone, \"but it is no matter, for here is a bag of gold which they gave me. The cat is the black cat of the witch who brought us home on her broomstick; so let me sleep, Mother, for I am weary with dancing at the Halloween frolic.\" He closed his eyes and slept again, while his mother examined the leather bag.\n\n\"Antone, my son!\" she screamed. \"Here is gold yellow as a pumpkin! Where have you been to gather such wealth?\" She shook him and gave him no peace until he waked fully and told the story. Even then his mother did not believe it, but threw up her hands and wept that her son should thus rave with fever.\n\nThe woodcutter and Babette came running to see what had happened, and at the sight of the second bag of gold the poor woman grew calmer. Babette showed the peppermint which the witch had given her, and the mother doubted no more.\n\n\"To receive a peppermint from a witch is surely a mark of great favor,\" said she, and began to laugh through her tears. \"I thought I was dreaming or that Antone raved of fever, for never in my life had I seen so much gold.\"\n\n\"It is like the fairies to bless the children of the poor,\" said the woodcutter. \"Now Antone will go to school, and Mother will have a handsome dress and shawl.\"\n\n\"And is it not as I said?\" cried his wife. \"A black cat coming on Halloween would bring us good luck, and here is the luck already!\"\n\nIt would have been hard to find a happier family than the woodcutter's as they set out for the village that day. When it was told that the woodcutter was looking for a pair of oxen, some folk laughed outright. The woodcutter was too poor to feed a pair of canaries, they declared; but when it became known that the woodcutter's wife had bought a new dress and a golden ring, they began to wonder who had died and left the woodcutter a fortune. Antone told the tale of their wealth to those who questioned him, and straightway the village children ran to throw their jack-o'-lanterns from the roofs and high places. But their pumpkins broke or stayed on the ground below where they had fallen (it was no longer Halloween, remember). At noon, when the woodcutter and his family sat down to dinner in the village inn, the landlord threatened to charge a penny from all who stood gazing through the windows. Some folk scoffed openly and declared it was a tale to tell children and dullards; but there were the two leather bags filled with gold. The greatest marvel of all was, that no matter how much the woodcutter or his wife spent from these, the bags always remained brimful of gold!\n\nAntone chose a pair of steel skates in the village shop and bought an armful of books for which he had longed. Babette, however, with her usual perverse ways, would have none of the dollies in the village toy shop. They were ugly, she declared, and their cheeks were not pink and beautiful as were the turnip dollies Antone made for her.\n\nA Tale for Halloween, pumpkin patchAnd ever after that the woodcutter and his wife were no longer poor folk. They had white bread and even butter every day of their lives, and on Sundays and holidays they had roasted fowl for their dinner. Antone went to school, and Babette had an embroidered frock which was the envy of every child in the village. Their mother no longer sighed as she went about her household tasks, and neither did she strain her eyes making fine laces for market. Instead she rode proudly on the seat of her husband's ox cart when he delivered wood in the village; sometimes she even drank tea with the mayor's wife! Visitors from far and near went to see the famous spot where Antone's vegetables all ran away one Halloween night; and to this day there lives not a man who can make grow on that land cabbages or turnips or any other vegetable, although in a spot in the forest, not far off, cabbages and pumpkins and all such vegetables grow wild.\n\nA Tale for Halloween, girl with catEach year, as regularly as Halloween came to mark the harvest time, Antone and Babette mounted the broomstick with the witch and rode off to the Halloween frolic. There they always found Pumpkin grown rounder and jollier than the year before, and they always rode home across the sky just as the dawn was breaking. The black cat became so fond of Babette that it never again rejoined its rightful mistress, but remained with the woodcutter and his family and brought them good luck for the rest of their days.",
